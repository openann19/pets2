===============================================
   ⚠️  ACTION REQUIRED: REBOOT NOW
===============================================

The GRUB fix has been applied successfully!

TO COMPLETE THE FIX:
--------------------
1. Close all apps
2. Click the main menu (bottom left)
3. Click the power button icon
4. Click "Reboot"

OR use terminal:
   sudo reboot

WHAT WILL HAPPEN:
-----------------
After reboot, your system should boot with:
  ✅ All 24 CPU cores enabled
  ✅ System runs 10-20x faster
  ✅ Proper ACPI power management
  ✅ Reboot works normally

VERIFICATION (after reboot):
---------------------------
Run these commands to confirm:
  nproc                    # Should show 24, not 1
  lscpu                    # Should show 24 cores, 32 threads

PRIORITY: HIGH - Your system is currently crippled with only 1 core!
