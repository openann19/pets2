## Usage in Mobile App

The admin API service now includes all safety moderation methods. The existing `AdminUploadsScreen` can be enhanced to use these new endpoints for:

1. **Better Data**: Get AI analysis data along with uploads
2. **Safety Scores**: Display moderation scores to admins
3. **Provider Info**: Show which AI provider analyzed the content
4. **Reason Tracking**: Detailed flag reasons from AI analysis

---

## Security

- ✅ Authentication required
- ✅ Admin role required
- ✅ All endpoints protected
- ✅ Audit logging for moderation decisions

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Update AdminUploadsScreen** to use new safety moderation endpoints
2. **Add Analysis Display** showing AI-detected labels and scores
3. **Add Safety Score Badge** on upload cards
4. **Add Filter by Provider** to see which AI analyzed content
5. **Add Threshold Configuration** UI for adjusting moderation thresholds

**Status**: ✅ BACKEND READY  
**Mobile Integration**: Needs UI updates to use new endpoints  
**Production Ready**: YES
