2. Typing Indicator
Right now, typingTimeoutRef is cleared and restarted every keypress, which is good. But if multiple users are typing, your match.isTyping state only tracks one person. You may want a more scalable solution for group chats:const [typingUsers, setTypingUsers] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

const handleTypingIndicator = ({ userId, isTyping }: any) => {
  setTypingUsers(prev => {
    const newSet = new Set(prev);
    if (isTyping) newSet.add(userId);
    else newSet.delete(userId);
    return newSet;
  });
};
3. Optimistic UI for Sending Messages

You’re doing this well with the tempMessage. A minor improvement: maybe add a “sending…” indicator for failed messages, so users know if something didn’t go through.<div className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-2xl ${message.status === 'sending' ? 'opacity-50' : ''}`}>
4. AI Suggestions

Good fallback to default suggestions if the API fails. Consider caching them per match so users don’t see them every time they reload:useEffect(() => {
  if (!aiSuggestions.length && messages.length === 0) {
    loadAiSuggestions();
  }
}, [messages]);
5. Scroll Behavior

scrollToBottom is fine, but sometimes AnimatePresence can animate new messages in slowly, so the scroll may jump. You could delay scroll slightly:useEffect(() => {
  const timeout = setTimeout(scrollToBottom, 100);
  return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
}, [messages]);
6. Image vs. Next.js Image

You’re using regular img for match photos. Consider using Next.js <Image> for optimization:<Image
  src={match?.petPhoto || '/placeholder-pet.jpg'}
  alt={match?.petName}
  width={40}
  height={40}
  className="rounded-full object-cover"
/>
7. Accessibility

Add aria-label to buttons with icons.

Consider role="status" for typing indicator for screen readers.

8. Minor Optimizations

messagesEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' }); could use behavior: 'auto' if you want immediate jump on load.

formatTime could be memoized if messages array is large.





1. Typing Animation

You’re using a looped Animated.sequence for the typing dots, which is fine. One thing to note is that currently all three dots animate in sync. Usually, typing indicators stagger the dots for a more realistic effect. You could modify it like this:[0, 1, 2].map((i) => (
  <Animated.View
    key={i}
    style={[
      styles.typingDot,
      {
        opacity: typingAnimation.interpolate({
          inputRange: [0, 1],
          outputRange: [0.3, 1],
        }),
        transform: [
          {
            translateY: typingAnimation.interpolate({
              inputRange: [0, 1],
              outputRange: [0, -3],
            }),
          },
        ],
        marginLeft: i * 3, // optional spacing
        animationDelay: i * 200, // stagger effect
      },
    ]}
  />
));
2. Scroll to Bottom

Currently, you’re using setTimeout to scroll after sending messages:setTimeout(() => {
  flatListRef.current?.scrollToEnd({ animated: true });
}, 100);
A more robust approach is to use onContentSizeChange in combination with scrollToEnd:<FlatList
  ref={flatListRef}
  data={messages}
  renderItem={renderMessage}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item._id}
  showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}
  contentContainerStyle={styles.messagesList}
  onContentSizeChange={() => flatListRef.current?.scrollToEnd({ animated: true })}
/>
3. Quick Replies

Currently, the quick reply auto-sends the message:onPress={() => {
  setInputText(item);
  sendMessage();
}}
Consider letting the user edit it first before sending:onPress={() => setInputText(item)}
4. Typing Indicator Logic

Right now, you simulate the other user typing every time after sending a message:setTimeout(() => {
  setOtherUserTyping(true);
  setTimeout(() => {
    setOtherUserTyping(false);
    // Add response
  }, 2000);
}, 1000);
For a real app, you would hook this into socket events like:socket.on('typing', (data) => setOtherUserTyping(data.isTyping));
5. Message Bubble Styling

You correctly handle left/right alignment. One small improvement is to align the last message timestamp nicely for both sides. Right now marginLeft/marginRight logic can be simplified:<View style={[styles.timeContainer, isMyMessage && { justifyContent: 'flex-end', marginRight: 15 }]}>
6. Code Cleanup

You have double try-catch in loadMessages. Only one is needed.

Inline avatar URLs are repeated. Consider moving them to a constant or using petAvatar prop for flexibility.

maxLength on TextInput is 500, which is fine; you could also show a character count optionally.

✅ Optional Enhancements

Message grouping by date: Show “Today”, “Yesterday”, or actual date headers.

Image messages support: You already have type: 'image' in the interface, but no render logic for images yet.

KeyboardAvoiding + FlatList: Sometimes the keyboard pushes the FlatList too high on Android. You could wrap the whole screen in KeyboardAvoidingView and KeyboardAwareScrollView for smoother behavior.

Performance: For large chat histories, consider initialNumToRender and windowSize props on FlatList.




1. Tab Handling

Right now, you have two tabs: Matches and Liked You. You’re using mock data for "Liked You", which is fine for demo. A few notes:

Consider extracting tabs into a small component to make the parent cleaner.

Currently, switching tabs does not trigger API calls for likes. If you want live data, call the API on tab change:



useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedTab === 'matches') {
    loadMatches();
  } else {
    loadLikedYou();
  }
}, [selectedTab]);
2. FlatList Optimization

You already use keyExtractor, which is good.

Consider adding initialNumToRender for long lists:initialNumToRender={10}
windowSize={10}


    For the grid in "Liked You", you correctly calculate width with (screenWidth - 60) / 2. Good for spacing consistency.3. Time Formatting

Your formatLastMessageTime handles minutes, hours, and days:if (diffInMinutes < 60) return `${diffInMinutes}m`;
else if (diffInMinutes < 1440) return `${Math.floor(diffInMinutes / 60)}h`;
else return `${Math.floor(diffInMinutes / 1440)}d`;
✅ Works fine. For improved UX, consider “Yesterday” instead of 1d, e.g.:if (diffInMinutes < 60) return `${diffInMinutes}m`;
else if (diffInMinutes < 1440) return `${Math.floor(diffInMinutes / 60)}h`;
else if (diffInMinutes < 2880) return 'Yesterday';
else return `${Math.floor(diffInMinutes / 1440)}d`;
4. Unread Badge

Good handling with conditional rendering:{item.unreadCount > 0 && (
  <View style={styles.unreadBadge}>
    <Text style={styles.unreadCount}>{item.unreadCount}</Text>
  </View>
)}
Optional improvement: cap the number at 99+:<Text style={styles.unreadCount}>
  {item.unreadCount > 99 ? '99+' : item.unreadCount}
</Text>
5. Navigation

You pass matchId and petName to the chat screen:navigation.navigate('Chat', { matchId: item._id, petName: item.petName })
6. FAB & Styling

Your floating action button (heart icon) is clear and stands out. Some minor enhancements:

Add hitSlop for easier tapping on smaller screens:<TouchableOpacity
  style={styles.fab}
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Swipe')}
  hitSlop={{ top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 10, right: 10 }}
>
Consider accessibility label for screen readers:accessibilityLabel="Start swiping"
7. Empty States

You already have a nice empty state with CTA button. Optionally:

Add animation (like Lottie) to make it more engaging.

Ensure responsive padding on smaller screens.

8. General Performance Tips

Use React.memo on renderMatch and renderLikedYou to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Use FlatList’s getItemLayout if you have uniform heights to speed up scrolling.

Consider pagination or infinite scroll if matches list can grow large.

9. Optional UX Enhancements

Show online dot also in the “Liked You” grid if possible.

Add swipe-to-delete for matches in case users want to remove old chats.

Add pull-to-refresh on “Liked You” tab for consistency.










~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~





All UI elements, screens, and components must use a **premium design system**:
- **Colors:** sophisticated palette, e.g., rich gradients, deep shadows, subtle accents. No flat or cheap colors. Example:
  - Primary: #FF6B6B (vibrant coral)
  - Secondary: #FF8E8E (soft gradient)
  - Accent: #FFD700 (luxury gold)
  - Background: #FFFFFF (light) / #121212 (dark)
  - Text: #333 (light) / #E0E0E0 (dark)
- **Dark Mode:** every screen, component, and modal must fully support dark mode:
  - Automatically switchable based on system theme
  - Use semantic colors (background, text, borders, shadows)
  - All gradients, icons, and microinteractions adapt to dark mode
- **Consistency:** all buttons, cards, FABs, headers, badges, modals, tabs, lists, and overlays must follow this premium color system
- **Shadows & Depth:** subtle yet noticeable shadows, smooth gradients, and rounded corners for a polished, designer-level feel
- **Accessibility:** maintain sufficient contrast and readability in both light and dark modes
