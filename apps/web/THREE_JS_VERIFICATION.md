- [x] `app/diagnostics/plr/page.tsx` - Safe scene route
- [x] `app/routes/Diagnostics/PrelaunchSafeScene.tsx` - Safe scene component

### Configuration

## Functionality Tests

### Install Dependencies
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm install
```

### Type Checking
```bash
pnpm typecheck
```
- [ ] No TypeScript errors related to Three.js effects

### Build Test
```bash
pnpm build
```
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors

### Runtime Tests

#### 1. Demo Page
```bash
pnpm dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/premium/effects-demo
```
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Effects render correctly
- [ ] Info overlay displays quality tier and flags

#### 2. Safe Scene
```bash
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/diagnostics/plr
```
- [ ] Minimal scene renders
- [ ] No heavy GPU usage
- [ ] Suitable for Play Pre-launch testing

#### 3. Feature Flags
- [ ] Edit `public/flags.json` to disable effects
- [ ] Refresh page - effects should be disabled
- [ ] Restore flags - effects should re-enable

#### 4. Query Parameters
- [ ] `?safeMode=1` - Effects should minimize
- [ ] `?quality=low` - Particle count should reduce
- [ ] `?quality=mid` - Medium quality settings
- [ ] `?quality=high` - Full quality settings

#### 5. Reduced Motion
- [ ] Enable "Reduce Motion" in OS settings
- [ ] Effects should respect preference
- [ ] Animations should slow down
- [ ] Particle counts should reduce

## Performance Checks

### Browser DevTools
1. Open Chrome DevTools → Performance
2. Record while viewing effects demo
3. Check:
   - [ ] No frame drops below 60fps (high-end devices)
   - [ ] GPU usage is reasonable
   - [ ] Memory doesn't leak over time
   - [ ] Animations are smooth

### Quality Tier Detection
- [ ] Low-end: Auto-scales to low tier
- [ ] Mid-range: Auto-scales to mid tier
- [ ] High-end: Uses full quality

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Test on mobile device or emulator
- [ ] Effects scale appropriately
- [ ] No performance issues
- [ ] Battery drain is acceptable

## Code Quality

### Linting
```bash
pnpm lint
```
- [ ] No linting errors

### Type Safety
- [ ] All components properly typed
- [ ] No `any` types in effect components
- [ ] Props interfaces exported

### Documentation
- [ ] README.md exists and is comprehensive
- [ ] JSDoc comments on exported functions
- [ ] Type definitions included

## Integration Points

### App Integration
- [x] FeatureFlagsProvider added to `app/providers.tsx`
- [ ] Verify flags are accessible throughout app
- [ ] Test flag changes propagate correctly

### Usage Examples
- [x] Demo page created
- [ ] Example code in README
- [ ] TypeScript examples provided

## Known Issues / Notes

### Dependencies
- `@react-three/fiber` must be installed: `pnpm install`
- `three` and `@types/three` already in dependencies

### Browser Support
- WebGL1 and WebGL2 supported
- Fallback for non-WebGL browsers (graceful degradation)

### Mobile Considerations
- Quality tiers auto-detect device capabilities
- DPR capped to prevent overdraw
- Reduced motion respected

## Next Steps After Verification

1. **Production Readiness**
   - [ ] Performance tested on target devices
   - [ ] Memory leaks checked
   - [ ] Bundle size acceptable

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Developer docs updated
   - [ ] API documentation complete
   - [ ] Examples provided

3. **Integration**
   - [ ] Effects integrated into premium pages
   - [ ] Feature flags configured for production
   - [ ] Monitoring added (optional)
