# UI/UX Audit & Modernization Plan

## Executive Summary

This audit examines the PawfectMatch web and mobile applications for UI/UX
consistency, performance, and accessibility. The analysis reveals significant
opportunities for improvement in design system adherence, performance
optimization, and user experience enhancements.

## 1. Design System & Consistency Audit

### Shared Component Usage

**Issue**: Inconsistent component usage between platforms **Location**:
apps/mobile/ (entire codebase) **Impact**: Platform-specific implementations
lead to maintenance overhead and inconsistent user experience
**Recommendation**: Migrate mobile app to use `@pawfectmatch/ui` package for all
UI components. Currently, mobile uses local StyleSheet implementations while web
uses shared components.

**Issue**: Custom image implementation instead of shared LazyImage **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:247-251 **Impact**: Inconsistent image loading
behavior and missed performance optimizations **Recommendation**: Replace
`<img>` tag with `LazyImage` component from `@/components/Performance/LazyImage`

### Design Token Purity

**Issue**: Hardcoded Tailwind color classes not from design tokens **Location**:
apps/web/app/page.tsx:204 (`bg-emerald-400`) **Impact**: Inconsistent branding
and difficulty maintaining theme changes **Recommendation**: Replace
`bg-emerald-400` with design token equivalent (consider `success` color from
tokens)

**Issue**: Hardcoded gradient colors in landing page **Location**:
apps/web/app/page.tsx:218 (`from-fuchsia-300 via-sky-300 to-violet-300`)
**Impact**: Colors not aligned with design system **Recommendation**: Use design
token gradients or define gradient tokens

**Issue**: Hardcoded button colors in browse page **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:204-205 (`from-pink-500 to-purple-600`) **Impact**:
Inconsistent with brand colors **Recommendation**: Replace with design token
colors

**Issue**: Hardcoded action button colors **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:321,331,350,360 (multiple `bg-red-500/20`,
`bg-pink-500/20`, etc.) **Impact**: Colors not from centralized theme
**Recommendation**: Create action color tokens and use consistently across
components

**Issue**: Hardcoded swipe indicator colors **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:374,384 (`bg-red-500/80`, `bg-pink-500/80`)
**Impact**: Inconsistent visual feedback **Recommendation**: Use design token
colors for swipe indicators

**Issue**: Hardcoded modal icon colors **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:413,415 (`text-pink-500`, `text-blue-500`)
**Impact**: Icons don't follow theme system **Recommendation**: Use theme colors
for modal icons

**Issue**: Hardcoded footer gradient **Location**: apps/web/app/page.tsx:282
(`from-pink-500 to-violet-500`) **Impact**: Not using design system gradients
**Recommendation**: Define footer gradient in design tokens

### Layout Consistency

**Issue**: Inconsistent spacing systems between platforms **Location**:
apps/web/ (uses Tailwind spacing), apps/mobile/ (uses custom Spacing object)
**Impact**: Inconsistent layouts and spacing across platforms
**Recommendation**: Standardize on design token spacing values. Update Tailwind
config to use token values or create a unified spacing system.

**Issue**: Inline styles mixed with className **Location**:
apps/web/app/page.tsx:36-38,43 (style props) **Impact**: Reduces maintainability
and consistency **Recommendation**: Move inline styles to CSS classes or use
CSS-in-JS consistently

## 2. Modernization & Performance Audit

### State Management

**Issue**: Mixed state management patterns **Location**: apps/web/ (uses Zustand
stores + extensive useState), apps/mobile/ (uses Zustand + useState) **Impact**:
Inconsistent data flow and potential for state synchronization issues
**Recommendation**: Establish clear guidelines: use Zustand for shared/global
state, useState for local component state. Audit and migrate inappropriate
useState usage to stores.

### Rendering Performance

**Issue**: Missing React.memo for expensive components **Location**:
apps/web/src/components/Pet/SwipeCard.tsx (large component with animations)
**Impact**: Unnecessary re-renders affecting performance **Recommendation**: Add
React.memo to SwipeCard and other complex components

**Issue**: No virtualization for potentially large lists **Location**:
apps/mobile/src/components/SwipeCard.tsx (renders multiple particles)
**Impact**: Performance degradation with many items **Recommendation**: Evaluate
if particle animations need virtualization or optimize rendering

### User Experience Enhancements

**Issue**: Generic loading spinners instead of skeleton loaders **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:69 (LoadingSpinner) **Impact**: Poor perceived
performance **Recommendation**: Implement SkeletonLoader from shared UI package
for better loading UX

**Issue**: Missing optimistic UI updates **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx (like/pass actions) **Impact**: UI feels sluggish
during user interactions **Recommendation**: Implement optimistic updates for
like/pass actions, revert on error

**Issue**: Blocking UI during actions **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:321-364 (button click handlers) **Impact**: Poor
responsiveness **Recommendation**: Add loading states and optimistic updates to
action buttons

## 3. Accessibility (A11y) Audit

### Semantic HTML & ARIA

**Issue**: Missing semantic heading structure **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:202-207 (h1 without proper hierarchy) **Impact**:
Screen readers can't navigate content structure **Recommendation**: Ensure
proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)

**Issue**: Buttons without accessible names **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:256-261,263-267 (navigation buttons with symbols)
**Impact**: Screen readers can't identify button purpose **Recommendation**: Add
aria-label attributes to navigation buttons

**Issue**: Missing ARIA labels on interactive elements **Location**:
apps/web/app/page.tsx:90-108 (mobile menu button) **Impact**: Screen readers
can't announce button state **Recommendation**: Add aria-expanded attribute to
mobile menu button

### Keyboard Navigation

**Issue**: Missing keyboard navigation support **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:254-283 (photo carousel) **Impact**: Keyboard users
can't navigate photos **Recommendation**: Add keyboard event handlers for arrow
key navigation

**Issue**: Focus management in modals **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:407-456 (login modal) **Impact**: Focus doesn't
return to trigger element **Recommendation**: Implement focus trapping and
proper focus return

### Color Contrast & Visual Accessibility

**Issue**: Potential contrast issues with glassmorphism **Location**:
apps/web/app/page.tsx (various glass elements) **Impact**: Low contrast text on
complex backgrounds **Recommendation**: Test contrast ratios and add fallbacks
for high contrast mode

**Issue**: Missing alt text validation **Location**:
apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:247-251 (pet images) **Impact**: Screen readers
can't describe images **Recommendation**: Ensure all images have descriptive alt
text

conversation? [COMPLETE] Is the chat real-time (e.g., using WebSockets)?
[MISSING] Does it support sending images or GIFs? [COMPLETE] Are there
"typing..." and "seen" indicators? [COMPLETE] Is there a clear way to unmatch or
report a user from within the chat? [COMPLETE] Granular push notification
settings (new matches, new messages)? [MISSING] A "Help Center" or FAQ section?
[COMPLETE] A fully functional account deletion flow that removes user data from
the database? Critical MVP Gaps Functional Authentication System - Login and
registration screens exist but do not connect to backend authentication. Users
cannot actually sign up or log in, making the entire app unusable for new users.
Social Login Integration - No Google or Apple login options available, which are
expected in modern social matching apps and significantly impact user
acquisition. Complete Profile Management - Profile creation is limited to basic
info and single avatar. Multi-photo upload, interests, breed information, and
profile preview are missing, reducing user engagement and match quality.
Implemented Swipe Filters - Filter UI exists but filters are not actually
applied to the swipe queue, meaning users cannot find relevant matches based on
preferences. Match Notification Flow - No "It's a Match!" celebration screen or
notification exists, missing a core emotional moment that drives conversation
initiation. Help Center/FAQ - No user support resources available, which is
critical for user retention and reducing support burden. Web Application
Authentication - Web app has no login/signup pages at all, despite having auth
components and protected routes. Forgot Password Functionality - Password reset
UI exists but has no backend implementation or email sending. Image Sharing in
Chat - Chat is text-only, missing a key engagement feature for sharing pet
photos and building connections.
