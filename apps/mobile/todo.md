services/AccessibilityService.ts â€“ Replace hex palettes/contrast inputs with theme-driven tokens or injected adapters; update helper outputs accordingly.
services/tests/AccessibilityService.test.ts â€“ Mirror service changes by seeding tests with theme-derived fixtures instead of hex literals; keep assertions intact.
screens/live/LiveStreamViewerScreen.tsx â€“ Add useTheme, move styles into useMemo, swap all literals.
hooks/animations/tests/useGlowEffect.test.ts â€“ Convert glow color mocks to theme fixtures.
components/tests/EnhancedTabBar.test.tsx â€“ Replace snapshot/reference colors with theme values or factory.
Repo-wide sweep (â‰ˆ750 remaining hits) â€“ Continue file-by-file migration following the established pattern.
Lint & Type Safety Follow-ups
Resolve outstanding react-hooks/immutability violations (e.g., EliteButton/EliteCard shared values) once color work lands.
Ensure no new 
typescript-eslint
 warnings (unused vars after refactors).
Run pnpm -w eslint apps/mobile and keep zero errors.
Test & Verification Gates
pnpm mobile:tsc â€“ confirm no regressions from theme refactors.
pnpm mobile:test (unit/integration) â€“ especially suites touching updated components/services.
Visual QA / contrast spot-checks after palette changes (light & dark).
Regression pass on premium flow (Premium Demo, AI Bio, Elite components) to ensure gradients & animations still render correctly.
Release Readiness (post-color work)
Detox / E2E golden paths once lint/tests pass.
Performance bump check (animations, gradients) to ensure no regressions.
Prep release notes & changelog entries for theme migration.

Unit/Integration Tests
 Fix Jest environment - Resolve React Native testing setup issues
 Hook testing - Complete tests for 30+ custom hooks (5/30 done)
 Component testing - Test all migrated theme components
 Service testing - Test theme-aware service implementations
Visual & Accessibility Testing
 Visual regression - Spot-check theme changes in light/dark modes
 Contrast validation - Ensure WCAG compliance after theme migration
 Accessibility audit - Verify screen reader and navigation support
Performance Testing
 Animation performance - Verify no regressions in theme animations
 Memory usage - Check for memory leaks in theme switching
 Bundle size - Ensure theme system doesn't bloat the app

88/892 violations resolved (10%)
ðŸ“ˆ Metrics
Files to migrate: ~200+ files with hardcoded colors
ESLint violations: 804 remaining
TypeScript errors: ~300 remaining
Test coverage: ~17% (5/30 hooks tested)
Release readiness: ~30% completeMost Difficult Files (Ranked by Complexity)
1. services/AccessibilityService.ts (18 violations) - HARDEST
Why hard: Complex contrast calculations, color validation logic, WCAG compliance
Challenge: Need to preserve accessibility math while using theme tokens
Risk: Breaking accessibility features if done wrong
2. hooks/animations/useUnifiedAnimations.ts (10+ violations) - VERY HARD
Why hard: Complex animation systems with dynamic color interpolation
Challenge: Animated values need theme-aware color transitions
Risk: Performance regressions in animations
3. screens/live/LiveStreamViewerScreen.tsx (18 violations) - HARD
Why hard: Real-time video overlays, dynamic UI states, complex styling
Challenge: Theme changes during active streams
Risk: Visual glitches during live streaming
4. Premium/Elite Components (Multiple files) - HARD
Why hard: Complex gradient systems, shadow effects, holographic styles
Challenge: Maintaining premium visual quality with themes
Risk: Degrading premium experience
