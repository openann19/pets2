# ADR-0001: Implementing AGENTS.md Quality Gates

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The AGENTS.md specification defines a comprehensive quality gate system for mobile app development. To ensure production readiness and maintainable code, we need automated checks for:

- TypeScript compliance
- Testing coverage
- Accessibility standards
- Performance budgets
- Security scanning
- API contract validation
- Internationalization coverage
- Telemetry completeness

## Decision
Implement the full AGENTS.md quality gate system with automated CI/CD integration.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Automated quality assurance
- Consistent code standards
- Early detection of issues
- Improved maintainability
- Production-ready deployments

### Negative
- Initial setup complexity
- CI/CD pipeline adjustments
- Team training requirements
- Tool installation and maintenance

## Implementation
- Bootstrap with `mobile:agents:bootstrap`
- Full validation with `mobile:agents:full`
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Regular monitoring and updates
