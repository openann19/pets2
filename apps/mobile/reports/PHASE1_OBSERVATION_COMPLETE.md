# Phase 1: Observation Complete

## Summary

Phase 1 of the O-P-A-R autonomous workflow has been completed. The following artifacts were generated:

### Generated Artifacts

1. **Product Model** (`reports/product_model.json`)
   - Extracted 6 domain entities (User, Pet, Match, Message, Subscription, Adoption)
   - Analyzed 78 screens with state detection
   - Identified 14 API endpoints with implementation status

2. **Navigation Graph** (`reports/navigation_graph.json`)
   - Mapped 9 root screens
   - Analyzed admin navigation structure
   - Tracked screen params and guards

3. **API Contracts** (`reports/api_contracts.json`)
   - Documented GDPR endpoints
   - Mapped chat, swipe, and premium endpoints
   - Identified mock server gaps

4. **Gap Log** (`reports/gap_log.json`)
   - Identified 6 critical gaps
   - Severity breakdown: 2 Critical, 3 High, 1 Medium
   - Documented acceptance criteria and test plans for each gap

5. **TypeScript Errors** (`reports/tsc-errors.txt`)
   - Captured existing TypeScript compilation errors
   - Over 50 errors detected in components
   - Will be addressed in P0/P1 work items

### Key Findings

#### Strengths
- GDPR APIs present (`deleteAccount`, `exportUserData`, `confirmDeleteAccount`)
- Premium service well-structured
- Testing infrastructure exists (Jest, Detox, mock server)
- Many screens implement loading/empty/error states

#### Critical Gaps (P0)
1. **GDPR E2E Tests Missing** - APIs exist but no E2E coverage
2. **Chat Media Not Implemented** - UI exists but upload/send logic missing
3. **SwipeScreen Actions Incomplete** - Report missing, undo untested

#### High Priority Gaps (P1)
4. **State Matrices** - Skeleton loaders missing
5. **A11y Compliance** - Missing labels/roles/testIDs
6. **E2E Journeys** - Only auth test exists

#### TypeScript Issues
- 50+ compilation errors
- Type mismatches in Advanced components
- Optional property handling issues
- Ref type conflicts

### Next Steps

Phase 2 will create detailed work items for:
- P0 items: GDPR E2E, Chat media, Swipe actions
- P1 items: State matrices, A11y, E2E journeys

Each work item will include:
- Problem statement
- User value
- Acceptance criteria
- States to implement
- Test plan (unit/integration/E2E)
- A11y requirements
- Performance budgets
