# ADR-0001: Testing Gates and Quality Assurance Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The PawfectMatch mobile application requires comprehensive quality gates to ensure production-ready code before deployment. This ADR establishes the testing strategy and quality gates enforced by the AGENTS.md multi-agent system.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered testing strategy with automated quality gates:

1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode, zero errors
2. **Linting**: ESLint with zero warnings
3. **Unit Tests**: Jest with >75% coverage
4. **Integration Tests**: Service-level integration tests
5. **E2E Tests**: Detox for critical user journeys
6. **Contract Tests**: API contract validation
7. **A11y Tests**: Accessibility compliance checks
8. **Performance Tests**: Performance budget enforcement
9. **Security Tests**: Dependency scans, PII audits
10. **Telemetry Tests**: Analytics coverage validation

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Early detection of bugs and regressions
- ✅ Consistent code quality across team
- ✅ Automated quality enforcement reduces manual review burden
- ✅ Clear metrics for continuous improvement
- ✅ Prevents breaking changes from reaching production

### Negative
- ⚠️ Initial setup overhead
- ⚠️ May slow down rapid prototyping (can be bypassed with approval)
- ⚠️ Requires maintenance as codebase evolves
- ⚠️ Additional CI/CD complexity

### Neutral
- CI pipeline time increases marginally
- Developer onboarding includes learning test patterns

## Rationale

### Type Safety
TypeScript strict mode catches errors at compile time, reducing runtime bugs and improving developer experience.

### Testing Hierarchy
- Unit: Fast, isolated, test business logic
- Integration: Validate service interactions
- E2E: Ensure end-to-end user journeys work
- Contract: Validate API compatibility

### Quality Metrics
Coverage thresholds are set to:
- 75% global coverage (maintainable)
- 90% for changed lines (ensures new code tested)

### Accessibility
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is required by law and improves UX for all users.

### Performance
Performance budgets prevent app bloat and maintain good user experience on low-end devices.

### Security
Regular dependency scans and PII audits prevent security vulnerabilities and data breaches.

## Implementation

### CI/CD Gates
All PRs must pass:
1. `pnpm mobile:typecheck` - TypeScript validation
2. `pnpm mobile:lint` - ESLint checks
3. `pnpm mobile:test:services` - Service tests
4. `pnpm mobile:test:ui` - UI tests
5. `pnpm mobile:contract:check` - Contract validation
6. `pnpm mobile:a11y` - Accessibility checks
7. `pnpm mobile:security` - Security scans
8. `pnpm mobile:telemetry` - Telemetry coverage

### E2E Critical Paths
Detox tests cover:
- Authentication flow
- Core swipe → match journey
- Chat send/receive
- Settings navigation
- GDPR export/delete flow
- Premium purchase flow

### Nightly Full Suite
Runs comprehensive audits:
- Full test suite with coverage reports
- Code graph analysis
- Performance benchmarks
- Security deep scans
- Telemetry coverage reports

## Alternatives Considered

### No Gates
- ❌ Risk of shipping broken code
- ❌ Manual review becomes bottleneck
- ❌ Inconsistent quality standards

### Manual Review Only
- ❌ Doesn't scale with team size
- ❌ Human error in reviews
- ❌ Slower feedback loop

### Minimal Gates (Lint + TypeCheck only)
- ⚠️ Misses integration issues
- ⚠️ No E2E validation
- ⚠️ Accessibility and security gaps
