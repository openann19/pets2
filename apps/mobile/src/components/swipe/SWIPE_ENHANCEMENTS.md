# Swipe Screen Enhancements

## Overview

Added three production-grade enhancements to the swipe/match experience:

1. **ConfettiBurst** - Match celebration effect
2. **SwipeGestureHints** - Onboarding gesture hints
3. **PeekSheet** - Next card preview

## Components

### 1. ConfettiBurst (`ConfettiBurst.tsx`)

Animated confetti celebration for matches with customizable intensity levels.

**Features:**

- Heavy particle animation with physics simulation
- Intensity modes: light (40), medium (80), heavy (150) particles
- Continuous bursts during match animation
- Haptic feedback integration
- Fully typed with configurable colors
- Auto-cleanup after completion

**Usage:**

```tsx
<ConfettiBurst
  show={showMatchModal}
  intensity="heavy"
  duration={4000}
  onComplete={() => setShowConfetti(false)}
/>
```

### 2. SwipeGestureHints (`SwipeGestureHints.tsx`)

First-time onboarding hints showing swipe gesture directions.

**Features:**

- Appears on first launch only
- Shows directional hints for left/right/up swipes
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- Persistent dismissal via AsyncStorage
- Color-coded by direction (red=pass, green=like, blue=super)
- Manual dismiss button

**Usage:**

```tsx
<SwipeGestureHints onDismiss={() => console.log('Hints dismissed')} />
```

### 3. PeekSheet (`PeekSheet.tsx`)

Subtle preview of the next card in the deck.

**Features:**

- Preview next card at bottom of screen
- Spring animation on show/hide
- Scale + opacity transitions
- Disabled (non-interactive)
- Visual peek indicator

**Usage:**

```tsx
<PeekSheet
  nextPet={pets[nextIndex]}
  show={true}
/>
```

## Integration

All components are integrated into `ModernSwipeScreen.tsx`:

1. **Gesture hints** appear above all cards
2. **Peek sheet** shows next card preview
3. **Confetti burst** triggers automatically when match modal appears
4. All animations respect accessibility settings

## Technical Details

### Performance

- Uses `react-native-reanimated` for 60fps animations
- Particle count optimized by intensity
- Efficient particle lifecycle management
- No memory leaks on component unmount

### Accessibility

- Respects `ReduceMotion` setting
- Proper ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- High contrast colors
- Dismissal stored persistently

### Design Consistency

- Uses unified Theme tokens
- Consistent with existing design system
- Matches EliteButton/FXContainer patterns
- Production-grade animations

## Testing

All components handle edge cases:

- Empty pet arrays
- Missing photos
- Network errors
- Rapid swipe interactions
- Memory pressure scenarios
