# Hooks Modularization - Completion Summary

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Hooks Extracted

#### Voice Recording (`apps/mobile/src/hooks/voice/`)
- ✅ `useVoiceRecording` - Recording state & operations
- ✅ `useVoicePlayback` - Playback control  
- ✅ `useVoiceProcessing` - Audio processing
- ✅ `useSlideToCancel` - Pan responder gesture
- ✅ `useVoiceSend` - Upload & send logic

#### Photo Editor (`apps/mobile/src/hooks/photo/`)
- ✅ `usePhotoPinchZoom` - Pinch-to-zoom gestures
- ✅ `usePhotoCompare` - Compare mode
- ✅ `usePhotoFilters` - Filter presets
- ✅ `useUltraExport` - Ultra export

#### Swipe Card (`apps/mobile/src/hooks/swipe/`)
- ✅ `usePhotoNavigation` - Photo index navigation
- ✅ `useSwipeActions` - Like/pass/super-like handlers

### 2. Components Refactored

- ✅ **VoiceRecorderUltra.tsx**: Fully refactored (784 → ~300 lines, 62% reduction)
- 🔄 **ModernSwipeCard.tsx**: Partially refactored (hooks integrated, needs style fixes)
- ⏳ **AdvancedPhotoEditor.tsx**: Hooks ready, pending refactor

### 3. Tests Created

- ✅ Test files created for all new hooks
- ⚠️ Tests need mock setup improvements (timeout issues)

## 🔧 Remaining Issues

1. **ModernSwipeCard.tsx**:
   - Missing `makeStyles` function
   - Pet type mismatch between hook and component
   - Unused variables need cleanup

2. **Test Suite**:
   - Mock setup needs refinement
   - Timeout issues to resolve
   - Better async handling

## 📊 Impact

- **Code Reduction**: VoiceRecorderUltra reduced by 62%
- **Reusability**: 11 new reusable hooks
- **Testability**: Each hook can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Fix `makeStyles` in ModernSwipeCard.tsx
2. Align Pet types between hook and component
3. Refactor AdvancedPhotoEditor.tsx to use hooks
4. Improve test mocks and fix timeouts
5. Add integration tests for hook combinations
