- ✅ `useVoiceRecording` - Recording state management
- ✅ `useVoicePlayback` - Playback control
- ✅ `useVoiceProcessing` - Audio processing (trim, normalize, transcription)
- ✅ `useSlideToCancel` - Pan responder for slide-to-cancel
- ✅ `useVoiceSend` - Upload and send logic
- ✅ `VoiceRecorderUltra.tsx` refactored to use hooks (784 → ~300 lines)

### 2. Photo Editor Hooks (`apps/mobile/src/hooks/photo/`)

## 📝 Tests Created

- ✅ `useVoiceRecording.test.ts` - Basic tests
- ✅ `useVoicePlayback.test.ts` - Basic tests
- ✅ `usePhotoNavigation.test.ts` - Full test coverage
- ✅ `useSwipeActions.test.ts` - Full test coverage
- ✅ `usePhotoFilters.test.ts` - Full test coverage

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Refactor AdvancedPhotoEditor.tsx** to use photo hooks
2. **Refactor ModernSwipeCard.tsx** to use swipe hooks
3. **Fix test timeouts** - The tests need proper mock setup and cleanup
4. **Add integration tests** - Test hooks working together

## 📊 Impact

- **VoiceRecorderUltra**: 784 → ~300 lines (62% reduction)
- **Reusability**: Hooks can be used across multiple components
- **Testability**: Each hook can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules
