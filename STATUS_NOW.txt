   CURRENT STATUS & WHAT TO DO
==============================================

‚úÖ FIX APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY
   - Problematic file removed
   - GRUB configuration updated
   - Backup created

‚ö†Ô∏è  YOU ARE STILL ON THE OLD BOOT
   - Current session still has acpi=off
   - Current session still has only 1 CPU core
   - This is normal - you need to reboot

üéØ WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:
   ----------------------
   1. Save all your work
   2. Close all applications
   3. Click menu ‚Üí Power button ‚Üí Reboot
   OR
   Run: sudo reboot

‚è±Ô∏è  REBOOT WILL TAKE NORMAL TIME
   - Don't worry if it seems slow to shutdown
   - The NEXT boot after this will be correct

‚úÖ AFTER REBOOT CHECK:
   -------------------
   nproc                    # Should show 24
   lscpu | grep "CPU(s)"    # Should show 24
   
   If it still shows 1, run:
   sudo bash /home/ben/Downloads/pets-fresh/fix-ubuntu-performance.sh
