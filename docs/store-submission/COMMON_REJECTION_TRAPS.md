**Last Updated**: January 2025

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REJECTION TRAPS (Fix Before Submit)

### 1. ATT False Positive (iOS)

**Problem:**
- `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` present in `Info.plist` but no tracking SDK, OR
- Tracking SDK present but no ATT implementation

**Rejection Reason:**
- "Your app uses tracking but doesn't request permission" OR
- "Your app requests tracking permission but doesn't use tracking"

**Current Status:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW REQUIRED
- NSUserTrackingUsageDescription present: ‚úÖ (app.config.cjs:38)
- Description: "PawfectMatch uses tracking to provide personalized content and improve your experience"
- Issue: Description is generic, and tracking SDK presence needs verification
```

**Fix Steps:**
1. **Audit SDKs**: Check if any SDKs actually track across apps:
   - RevenueCat: Does NOT require ATT ‚úÖ
   - Analytics SDKs (Firebase, Amplitude, etc.): May require ATT
   - Advertising SDKs (AdMob, etc.): Require ATT
2. **Decision Tree**:
   ```
   IF tracking SDKs present:
     - Keep NSUserTrackingUsageDescription
     - Implement ATT dialog (requestTrackingPermissionAsync)
     - Update description to be specific: "PawfectMatch uses tracking to show you pets that match your preferences"
   ELSE (no tracking SDKs):
     - Remove NSUserTrackingUsageDescription
     - No ATT implementation needed
   ```
3. **Action Required**:
   - [ ] Audit all SDKs for tracking behavior
   - [ ] If tracking present: Implement ATT + update description
   - [ ] If no tracking: Remove NSUserTrackingUsageDescription

**Prevention:**
- Only include ATT key if tracking SDKs are actually present
- Test ATT dialog appears only when tracking is enabled
- Use specific, non-generic description text

### 2. External Payment Links Without Documentation (iOS)

**Problem:**
- App contains external payment links (US/EU) without using Apple's updated 2025 allowances
- Missing explanation in Review Notes

**Rejection Reason:**
- "Your app contains external payment links that violate Guideline 3.1.3"

**Current Status:**
```
‚úÖ VERIFIED
- All payments via IAP (RevenueCat) ‚úÖ
- No external payment links detected
- Status: PASS (no action needed)
```

**If External Links Exist:**
1. **Document in Review Notes**:
   ```
   EXTERNAL PAYMENT LINKS (if applicable):
   - Link appears on: [EXACT_SCREEN_NAME]
   - Purpose: [REASON - e.g., "Legacy subscription management"]
   - User flow: [HOW USER ACCESSES]
   - Compliance: [HOW IT COMPLIES WITH APPLE'S 2025 RULES]
   ```
2. **Ensure Compliance**: 
   - Only for specific exemptions (reader apps, etc.)
   - Not for digital goods subscriptions
   - Proper disclosure to users

**Prevention:**
- Remove all external payment links for digital goods
- Use IAP exclusively for subscriptions
- Document any exemptions in Review Notes

### 3. Play Data Safety Claims Don't Match SDK Behavior (Android)

**Problem:**
- Data Safety form claims don't match actual SDK behavior
- Missing data types or incorrect sharing declarations

**Rejection Reason:**
- "Your app's Data Safety section doesn't accurately reflect your app's data collection"

**Current Status:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFICATION REQUIRED
- Data Safety form needs completion
- SDK audit required to match declarations
```

**Fix Steps:**
1. **Audit All SDKs**:
   ```
   Check each SDK:
   - RevenueCat: Subscription data (doesn't share)
   - Analytics SDKs: May collect device ID, usage data
   - Crash reporting: May collect device info, crash logs
   - Push notifications: Device tokens
   - Location SDKs: Location data
   ```
2. **Match Data Safety Form**:
   - List every data type collected
   - Declare sharing accurately (shared vs not shared)
   - Specify purpose (app functionality, analytics, etc.)
   - Mark optional vs required
3. **Action Required**:
   - [ ] Complete SDK audit
   - [ ] Fill Data Safety form accurately
   - [ ] Verify no mismatches between form and code

**Prevention:**
- Audit SDKs before filling Data Safety form
- Update form whenever SDKs change
- Be conservative (if unsure, declare as collected)

### 4. Target API Too Low (Android)

**Problem:**
- New updates not targeting API 35 (Android 15)
- Existing apps not at least API 34 by Aug 31, 2025

**Current Status:**
```
‚ùå ACTION REQUIRED
- Current targetSdkVersion: 34 (app.config.cjs:52)
- Required: 35 (for new submissions/updates)
- Deadline: Immediate (for new submissions)
```

**Fix Steps:**
1. **Update app.config.cjs**:
   ```javascript
   android: {
     targetSdkVersion: 35,
     compileSdkVersion: 35,
     // ... rest of config
   }
   ```
2. **Test on Android 15**:
   - Build with API 35
   - Test on Android 15 emulator/device
   - Verify no breaking changes
3. **Update build config**:
   - Verify `eas.json` doesn't override targetSdkVersion
   - Rebuild AAB with new target
4. **Action Required**:
   - [ ] Update targetSdkVersion to 35
   - [ ] Update compileSdkVersion to 35
   - [ ] Test on Android 15
   - [ ] Rebuild production AAB

**Prevention:**
- Always target latest API level for new submissions
