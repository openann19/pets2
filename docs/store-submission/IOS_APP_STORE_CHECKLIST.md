### App Tracking Transparency (ATT)
- [ ] **ATT Key Present**: `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` in `Info.plist` ‚úÖ (from app.config.cjs:38)
- [ ] **ATT Implementation**: `requestTrackingPermissionAsync()` called only when tracking SDK is actually used
- [ ] **SDK Audit**: Verify which SDKs actually track:
  - [ ] RevenueCat - Does NOT require ATT (doesn't track across apps)
  - [ ] Analytics SDKs (if any) - May require ATT
  - [ ] Advertising SDKs (if any) - Require ATT
- [ ] **Usage Description Text**: Clear, non-generic, explains benefit
  - Current: "PawfectMatch uses tracking to provide personalized content and improve your experience" ‚ö†Ô∏è **Too generic - needs specific benefit**

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
- [ ] Update `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` to be specific: "PawfectMatch uses tracking to show you pets that match your preferences and improve matching accuracy"
- [ ] Verify ATT dialog only appears if tracking SDKs are actually present and used
- [ ] If no tracking SDKs, remove `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` (false positive triggers rejection)

**Reviewer Notes for ATT:**
```
APP TRACKING TRANSPARENCY:
- ATT is implemented only if analytics/tracking SDKs are present
- If ATT prompt appears, it means tracking SDK is active
- User can deny tracking; app continues to function normally
- Tracking is used for: Personalized pet recommendations, match quality improvement
```

- [ ] **Data Removal**: Backend erases or schedules data removal within 30-day grace period ‚úÖ
