# ‚úÖ Store Submission Fixes - Implementation Summary
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Completed  
**App**: PawfectMatch Premium

---

## üéØ Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ iOS: Removed ATT Key (App Tracking Transparency)

**Issue**: `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` present but no tracking SDKs requiring ATT
- Generic description detected: "PawfectMatch uses tracking to provide personalized content..."
- Risk: False positive rejection if Apple detects no tracking implementation

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ RevenueCat: IAP management only, does NOT require ATT
- ‚úÖ Sentry: Error tracking only, does NOT require ATT  
- ‚úÖ Telemetry system: Internal app metrics only, does NOT track across apps
- ‚úÖ Observability service: Uses Sentry for error tracking, does NOT require ATT
- ‚ùå No analytics SDKs found (Amplitude, Mixpanel, Firebase Analytics, etc.)
- ‚ùå No advertising SDKs found (AdMob, etc.)

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` from `app.config.cjs`
- Added comment explaining removal: No tracking SDKs require ATT

**File Changed**: `apps/mobile/app.config.cjs:38-39`

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - No false positive rejection risk

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Android: Updated Target API to 35

**Issue**: App targeting API 34, but new submissions require API 35 (Android 15)

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `targetSdkVersion: 35` (was 34)
- Updated `compileSdkVersion: 35` (was 34)

**File Changed**: `apps/mobile/app.config.cjs:105-106`

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Meets Play Store requirement

**Testing Required**:
- [ ] Test app on Android 15 emulator/device
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes from API 35 restrictions
- [ ] Rebuild production AAB: `eas build --platform android --profile production`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Android: Removed Unused Permissions

**Permissions Removed**:

1. **`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`**
   - **Reason**: App uses location only "when in use" (foreground only)
   - **Evidence**: LocationService defaults to `enableBackground: false`
   - **Status**: Removed ‚úÖ

2. **`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`**
   - **Reason**: Using scoped storage (Android 10+)
   - **Replacement**: `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` and `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` (Android 13+)
   - **Status**: Removed ‚úÖ

3. **`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`**
   - **Reason**: Using scoped storage (Android 10+)
   - **Replacement**: Scoped storage APIs (no permission needed)
   - **Status**: Removed ‚úÖ

**Files Changed**: 
- `apps/mobile/app.config.cjs:112-127` - Permissions removed
- `apps/mobile/app.json:48-70` - Updated to match app.config.cjs (targetSdkVersion 35, permissions aligned)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Permissions aligned with actual usage

**Code Verification**:
- ‚úÖ `LocationService.ts`: Background location method documented as unused (enableBackground: false by default)
- ‚úÖ `GeofencingService.ts`: Uses foreground-only location tracking (no enableBackground flag set)
- ‚úÖ File storage: Uses scoped storage APIs (`expo-document-picker`, `expo-file-system`) - no deprecated permissions needed

## üìù Notes

### ATT Removal Decision

We removed `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` because:
1. No tracking SDKs present that require ATT (RevenueCat, Sentry don't require it)
2. Internal telemetry/analytics don't track across apps for advertising
3. Keeping it would risk false positive rejection if Apple doesn't detect ATT implementation

If tracking SDKs are added in the future:
- Re-add `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` with specific, non-generic description
- Implement ATT dialog: `requestTrackingPermissionAsync()`
- Update App Privacy questions to reflect tracking

### Background Location

Background location permission (`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`) was removed from Android because:
1. App defaults to foreground-only location (`enableBackground: false`)
2. Background location requires strong justification in Play Store
3. App functionality works with "when in use" location only

If background location is needed in the future:
- Add back `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permission
- Implement foreground disclosure (required by Android)
- Document use case in Play Console reviewer notes
- Provide strong justification for background location

### Storage Permissions

Removed `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` because:
1. App uses scoped storage (Android 10+)
2. Media access uses `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`/`READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` (Android 13+)
3. No need for broad storage access

If any code references these permissions:
- Update to use scoped storage APIs
- Use `expo-file-system` or `expo-document-picker` APIs
- Test on Android 10+ devices
