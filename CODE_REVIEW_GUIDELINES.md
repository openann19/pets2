- [ ] Sensitive data is properly handled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization is correct
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials

#### Performance (Medium)

- [ ] Bundle size impact is minimal
- [ ] Rendering performance is optimized
- [ ] Memory usage is efficient
- [ ] Network requests are optimized

### 3. Review Process

#### For Reviewers

1. **Read the Code Thoroughly**
   - Understand the purpose and context
   - Check for potential issues
   - Verify implementation matches requirements

2. **Test the Changes**
   - Run the code locally
   - Verify functionality works as expected
   - Check for regressions

3. **Provide Constructive Feedback**
   - Be specific about issues
   - Suggest improvements
   - Explain the reasoning behind feedback

4. **Approve or Request Changes**
   - Approve only when confident
   - Request changes for any issues
   - Provide clear next steps

#### For Authors

1. **Respond to Feedback**
   - Address all comments
   - Ask questions if unclear
   - Update code accordingly

2. **Update Tests**
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update existing tests if needed
   - Ensure all tests pass

3. **Document Changes**
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update changelog if applicable

### 4. Quality Standards

#### TypeScript Standards

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Explicit types
interface UserData {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
}

function getUser(id: string): Promise<UserData> {
  // Implementation
}

// ❌ Bad: Implicit any
function getUser(id) {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Error Handling Standards

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive error handling
async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<UserData> {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ApiError) {
      throw new UserNotFoundError(`User ${id} not found`);
    }
    throw new UnexpectedError('Failed to fetch user');
  }
}

// ❌ Bad: Poor error handling
async function fetchUser(id: string) {
  const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
  return response.data;
}
```

#### Testing Standards

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive test coverage
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should fetch user by id', async () => {
    const mockUser = { id: '1', name: 'John' };
    jest.spyOn(api, 'get').mockResolvedValue({ data: mockUser });

    const result = await userService.getUser('1');

    expect(result).toEqual(mockUser);
    expect(api.get).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/users/1');
  });

  it('should handle user not found error', async () => {
    jest.spyOn(api, 'get').mockRejectedValue(new ApiError('Not found'));

    await expect(userService.getUser('999')).rejects.toThrow(UserNotFoundError);
  });
});
```

### 5. Automated Checks

The following automated checks are enforced:

- **TypeScript Compilation**: All types must be valid
- **ESLint Rules**: Code must follow style guidelines
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage required
- **Security Audit**: No known vulnerabilities
- **Performance Budget**: Bundle size limits enforced
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### 6. Review Templates

#### Approval Template

```
✅ **Approved**

This PR meets all quality standards:
- [x] Type safety verified
- [x] Tests passing
