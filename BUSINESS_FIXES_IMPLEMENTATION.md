## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Still Pending

### 3. Feature Gates Implementation
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Infrastructure exists but not consistently applied

**Current State**:
- `useFeatureGating` hook exists
- `PremiumGate` components exist

- Apply feature gates to:
  - Super Likes
  - Profile Boosts
  - Advanced Filters
  - Read Receipts
  - Video Calls
  - AR Features
  - Undo Swipes
  - See Who Liked You
- Ensure free tier limits are enforced (5 swipes/day)

### 4. Real-Time Chat

- Test message status indicators (sent/delivered/read)
- Ensure offline queue processes correctly
- Add message search functionality
- Implement message reactions
- Add media sharing (images, voice, files)

### 5. Premium Features Implementation

- Message Reactions (needs implementation)
- Message Attachments (needs implementation)

### 6. Map System
**Status**: ‚ùå Not Started

**Missing**:
- Real-time activity pins
- AR integration
- Location permissions handling
- Background location tracking
- Geofencing
- Heatmap visualization
- Clustering
