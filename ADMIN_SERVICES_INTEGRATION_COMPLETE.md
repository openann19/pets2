## API Integration

### Future Enhancement

The Services screen currently shows mock data. To integrate with backend:

```typescript
// Backend route to add
GET /api/admin/services/status

// Response format
{
  services: [
    {
      name: string;
      status: 'operational' | 'degraded' | 'down';
      responseTime: number;
      lastChecked: string;
      endpoint?: string;
      description: string;
    }
  ]
}
```

### Current Implementation

```typescript
// Mock services for now
const mockServices: ServiceStatus[] = [
  // ... service definitions
];

// In loadServices():
setServices(mockServices);
```
