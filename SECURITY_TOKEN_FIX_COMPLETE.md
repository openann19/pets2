# üîí Security Token Storage Fix - Implementation Complete

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented httpOnly cookie-based token storage to replace insecure localStorage token storage. All authentication tokens are now stored in httpOnly cookies set by the backend, protecting against XSS attacks.

---

## Changes Implemented

### Backend Changes ‚úÖ

1. **Updated `login` endpoint** (`server/src/controllers/authController.ts`)
   - Sets httpOnly cookies for `accessToken` and `refreshToken`
   - Returns tokens in response body only in development mode (backwards compatibility)

2. **Updated `register` endpoint** (`server/src/controllers/authController.ts`)
   - Sets httpOnly cookies for `accessToken` and `refreshToken`
   - Returns tokens in response body only in development mode

3. **Updated `biometricLogin` endpoint** (`server/src/controllers/authController.ts`)
   - Sets httpOnly cookies for `accessToken` and `refreshToken`
   - Returns tokens in response body only in development mode

4. **Updated `logout` endpoint** (`server/src/controllers/authController.ts`)
   - Clears httpOnly cookies on logout
   - Fixed TypeScript errors with MongoDB operators

5. **Updated `refreshAccessToken` middleware** (`server/src/middleware/auth.ts`)
   - Reads refresh token from httpOnly cookies (with fallback to request body)
   - Sets new tokens in httpOnly cookies
   - Added `getRefreshTokenFromCookies()` helper function

6. **Updated Socket.IO authentication** (`server/src/services/chatSocket.ts`)
   - Added support for reading tokens from cookies in Socket.IO handshake
   - Supports both token-based (legacy) and cookie-based authentication

### Client Changes ‚úÖ

1. **Updated `auth-store.ts`** (`apps/web/src/lib/auth-store.ts`)
   - Removed localStorage token storage
   - Updated token storage functions to be no-ops (tokens come from cookies)
   - Updated `initializeAuth()` to validate via API call (cookies sent automatically)
   - Removed tokens from Zustand persist partialize (only user data persisted)

2. **Updated `api.ts`** (`apps/web/src/services/api.ts`)
   - Removed localStorage token storage and initialization
   - Updated all API requests to use `credentials: 'include'` for cookie support
   - Removed Authorization header (tokens come from cookies)
   - Updated `refreshAccessToken()` to use cookies instead of body
   - Updated login/register to handle tokens in cookies (dev mode backwards compatibility)

3. **Updated `api-client.ts`** (`apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts`)
   - Updated WebSocket connection to use cookie-based auth
   - Socket.IO automatically sends cookies with handshake
   - Server reads tokens from cookies in Socket.IO middleware

## Security Improvements

### Before (INSECURE):
- ‚ùå Tokens stored in localStorage ‚Üí XSS attacks can steal tokens
- ‚ùå Cookies accessible via JavaScript ‚Üí XSS can read cookies
- ‚ùå Tokens persist across sessions ‚Üí Higher attack window

### After (SECURE):
- ‚úÖ Tokens in httpOnly cookies ‚Üí JavaScript cannot access
- ‚úÖ Cookies only sent over HTTPS in production (`secure: true`)
- ‚úÖ SameSite=strict ‚Üí CSRF protection
- ‚úÖ No localStorage tokens ‚Üí XSS cannot steal tokens
- ‚úÖ Automatic cookie handling ‚Üí Tokens sent with every request

---

## Configuration

### Cookie Settings:
- **httpOnly**: `true` (JavaScript cannot access)
- **secure**: `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` (HTTPS only in production)
- **sameSite**: `'strict'` (CSRF protection)
- **maxAge**: 
  - Access token: 15 minutes
  - Refresh token: 7 days
- **path**: `'/'`

### CORS Configuration:
- Already configured with `credentials: true` in `server/server.ts`
- Required for cookies to be sent cross-origin

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login sets httpOnly cookies
- [ ] Refresh token sets new cookies
- [ ] Logout clears cookies
- [ ] API requests include cookies automatically
- [ ] WebSocket connection uses cookies
- [ ] No tokens in localStorage
- [ ] No tokens accessible via JavaScript
- [ ] Works in development (tokens in response for backwards compatibility)
- [ ] Works in production (tokens ONLY in httpOnly cookies)

---

## Migration Notes

1. **Development Mode**: Tokens are still returned in response body for backwards compatibility
2. **Production Mode**: Tokens are ONLY in httpOnly cookies
3. **WebSocket**: Socket.IO automatically sends cookies with handshake if CORS credentials enabled
4. **Mobile App**: Already uses secure storage (expo-secure-store) - no changes needed

---

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `server/src/controllers/authController.ts`
- `server/src/middleware/auth.ts`
- `server/src/services/chatSocket.ts`

### Frontend:
- `apps/web/src/lib/auth-store.ts`
- `apps/web/src/services/api.ts`
- `apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts`

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Remove development mode token return** (after all clients updated)
2. **Add cookie rotation** (rotate refresh tokens periodically)
3. **Add cookie-based CSRF protection** (already partially implemented)
4. **Monitor cookie usage** in production logs

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and ready for testing
