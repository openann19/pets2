# 🎬 Motion Migration Progress Report

## Summary

**Status**: Phase 2 Component Migration ~75% Complete  
**Date**: Current Session  
**Components Migrated**: 15/20+ (was 9/20+)

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### Phase 1: Foundation (100% Complete) ✅
- ✅ Enhanced `foundation/motion.ts` with 7 advanced spring presets
- ✅ Added `fromVelocity()` helper function
- ✅ Type exports for all motion tokens
- ✅ Enhanced motion primitives (VelocityBasedScale, OvershootSpring, StaggeredEntrance)

### Phase 2: Advanced Gestures (100% Complete) ✅
- ✅ Magnetic gesture hook (`useMagneticGesture.ts`)
  - Velocity-based snapping
  - Distance-based snapping
  - Boundary resistance
  - Haptic feedback
  - Reduced motion support
- ✅ Momentum animation hook (`useMomentumAnimation.ts`)
  - Physics-based decay
  - Spring-based momentum
  - Velocity-to-spring conversion
- ✅ Integration: `NotificationCenterSheet` now uses magnetic gesture

### Component Migration (15/20+ Components) ✅

#### Recently Migrated (This Session):
1. ✅ **PetCard** (`components/ui/PetCard.tsx`)
   - Migrated `withTiming` to use `durations.md` and `motionEasing.enter`
   - Removed hardcoded `duration: 300` and `Easing.out(Easing.ease)`

2. ✅ **BaseButton** (`components/buttons/BaseButton.tsx`)
   - Migrated hardcoded spring config `{ damping: 15, stiffness: 400 }` → `springs.velocity`
   - Migrated hardcoded timings `duration: 150/200` → `durations.xs/sm`
   - Added proper easing curves from foundation

3. ✅ **Button (v2)** (`components/ui/v2/Button.tsx`)
   - Migrated from `theme/motion` imports to direct `@/foundation/motion` imports
   - Updated to use `scales.pressed` and `springs.standard` from foundation

4. ✅ **useRippleEffect** (`hooks/animations/useRippleEffect.ts`)
   - Migrated hardcoded `duration: 300` → `durations.md`
   - Added proper easing curves (`motionEasing.enter` and `motionEasing.exit`)

5. ✅ **usePulseEffect** (`hooks/animations/usePulseEffect.ts`)
   - Migrated hardcoded `duration: 1000` → `durations.lg * 3` (960ms)
   - Added proper easing curves for pulse up/down

6. ✅ **Sheet (v2)** (`components/ui/v2/Sheet.tsx`)
   - Migrated hardcoded `duration: 200` → `durations.sm`
   - Added proper easing curves for enter/exit

#### Previously Migrated:
- ✅ NotificationCenterSheet
- ✅ MotionPrimitives
- ✅ ReadByPopover
- ✅ MessageStatusTicks
- ✅ EmptyState
- ✅ RetryBadge
- ✅ AdvancedPetFilters
- ✅ Toast
- ✅ MessageWithEnhancements
- ✅ ReplyPreviewBar
- ✅ MessageTimestampBadge

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Migration Pattern Applied:
```typescript
// Before
withTiming(1, { duration: 300, easing: Easing.out(Easing.ease) })
withSpring(1, { damping: 15, stiffness: 400 })

// After
import { durations, motionEasing, springs } from '@/foundation/motion';
withTiming(1, { duration: durations.md, easing: motionEasing.enter })
withSpring(1, springs.velocity)
```

### Key Improvements:
- **Single Source of Truth**: All motion values now come from `@/foundation/motion`
- **Consistent Timing**: Standardized durations (xs: 120ms, sm: 180ms, md: 240ms, lg: 320ms)
- **Proper Easing**: Named easing curves by intent (enter, exit, emphasized)
- **Advanced Springs**: Velocity-based and physics-accurate spring presets
- **Worklet Support**: Proper worklet directives for SharedValue mutations

## 📊 Remaining Work

### Component Migration (~5-10 more components)
High-priority candidates:
- [ ] SwipeDeck (uses hardcoded transforms)
- [ ] ModernSwipeCard (likely has animation configs)
- [ ] GlassCardEnhanced
- [ ] ThreeDCard
- [ ] ConfettiCelebration
- [ ] ParticleCelebration
- [ ] MorphingContextMenu
- [ ] EliteCard
- [ ] EliteButton

### Phase 3: Shared Element Transitions (Next)
- [ ] Implement hero animation system
- [ ] Card → Detail screen transitions
- [ ] Image → Full screen viewer transitions
- [ ] Profile picture → Profile screen transitions

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for motion primitives (≥75% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for gesture hooks
- [ ] Performance validation (60fps, bundle size)
- [ ] E2E tests for critical animation flows

---

## 🎯 Quality Gates

### Current Status:
- ✅ TypeScript strict: Passes
- ✅ ESLint: Zero errors
- ✅ All migrations validated
- ✅ Proper worklet directives applied

### Next Steps:
1. Continue migrating remaining components
2. Start Phase 3 (Shared Element Transitions)
3. Write comprehensive test suite
4. Performance profiling and optimization

---

## 📝 Notes

- All migrations follow the established pattern from `foundation/motion.ts`
- Reduced motion support maintained throughout
- No breaking changes to component APIs
- Backward compatibility preserved where needed
- Proper worklet directives added for SharedValue mutations
