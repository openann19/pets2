**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Status:** Not Needed  
**Reason:** Screens already have good error handling

## Investigation Results

### MapScreen.tsx ✅
- Already has loading states
- Uses `useMapScreen` hook for state management
- Good integration with MapViewComponent
- Proper empty state handling

### CreateReelScreen.tsx ✅  
- Already has error handling in try/catch blocks
- Proper loading states with progress
- Alert.alert for error messages
- Clean state management

## Conclusion
