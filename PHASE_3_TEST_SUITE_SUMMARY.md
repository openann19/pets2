## Edge Cases and Resilience Testing

### Race Conditions
- Concurrent match requests
- Simultaneous swipes on same pet
- Multiple session creation
- Database transaction conflicts

### Network Failures  
- Offline mode handling
- Request retry logic
- Partial data loading
- Connection recovery

### Security Vulnerabilities
- IDOR attack prevention
- XSS input sanitization
- SQL/NoSQL injection prevention
- CSRF token validation
- Rate limiting implementation

### Performance Testing
- Large dataset handling (10,000+ pets)
- Memory leak detection
- Bundle size monitoring
- Core Web Vitals compliance

## Visual Regression Testing

### Implementation Plan
- **Tool**: Percy or Chromatic
- **Coverage**:
  - Key UI components
  - Critical user flows
  - Responsive breakpoints
  - Dark/light theme switching
  - Loading and error states

### Snapshot Tests Created
- Pet card components
- Match notification modals
- Chat interface
- Profile forms
- Map visualization

## Accessibility Testing

### Automated Checks
- **jest-axe** integration for unit tests
- **cypress-axe** for E2E tests
- WAVE API integration
- Lighthouse CI checks

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] High contrast mode
- [ ] 200% zoom support
- [ ] Focus management
- [ ] ARIA attributes

## Test Execution Scripts

### Package.json Updates
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "test:coverage": "turbo run test:coverage",
    "test:e2e": "turbo run test:e2e", 
    "test:a11y": "turbo run test:a11y",
    "test:security": "turbo run test:security",
    "test:visual": "percy exec -- turbo run test:visual",
    "test:performance": "turbo run test:performance",
    "test:all": "npm run test:coverage && npm run test:e2e && npm run test:a11y"
  }
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Parallel test execution
- Coverage reporting to Codecov
- Performance budget checks
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Accessibility score validation

### Quality Gates
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Performance score > 90
- All E2E tests passing

## Next Steps for Phase 4

### 1. Execute All Validation Scripts
```bash
pnpm lint --fix
pnpm type-check
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:a11y
pnpm test:security
```

### 2. Remediate Issues

- Address failing tests
- Improve coverage gaps
- Fix accessibility violations

### 3. Final Verification
- Zero exit codes on all scripts
- 100% critical path coverage
- Production deployment ready
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security audit passed
