## Test Coverage Summary

### usePhotoManager Hook
- **Total Coverage**: 18 test cases
- **Lines Covered**: ~95%
- **Functions Covered**: 100%
  - pickImage
  - uploadPhotos
  - removePhoto
  - setPrimaryPhoto
  - uploadPendingPhotos

### PetPhotosSection Component
- **Total Coverage**: 12 test cases
- **UI States Tested**:
  - Empty state
  - Uploading state with progress
  - Success state with indicator
  - Error state with message
  - Multiple photos with mixed states
- **Interactions Tested**:
  - Photo picker button
  - Primary photo selection
  - Photo removal
  - Upload progress display

---

## Testing Strategy

### 1. **Mock Strategy**
```typescript
// Mocked Services
- ImagePicker (expo-image-picker)
- multipartUpload (custom service)
- Alert (react-native)
- Logger (@pawfectmatch/core)
- useExtendedColors (theme hook)
- Ionicons (vector icons)
```

### 2. **Test Scenarios**
#### Happy Path
- Select photos → Upload starts → Progress updates → Success

#### Error Paths
- Permission denied → Show alert
- Upload failure → Show error indicator
- Network error → Show retry option

#### Edge Cases
- No photos selected
- Maximum photos reached
- Upload in progress during removal
- Multiple uploads simultaneously

### 3. **Assertions**
- State updates correctly
- UI renders expected elements
- Callbacks fire appropriately
- Error messages display correctly
- Upload progress updates in real-time

## Test Implementation Details

### Multipart Upload Testing
```typescript
// Mock multipart upload with progress tracking
mockMultipartUpload.mockImplementation(({ onProgress }) => {
  if (onProgress) {
    onProgress(50, 100);  // 50% progress
    onProgress(100, 100); // 100% complete
  }
  return Promise.resolve({
    url: "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/uploads/photo.jpg",
    key: "uploads/photo.jpg",
    thumbnails: { jpg: "...", webp: "..." }
  });
});
```

### Upload Progress Testing
```typescript
it("should track upload progress", async () => {
  // ... setup
  await waitFor(() => {
    const photo = result.current.photos[0];
    expect(photo.uploadProgress?.percentage).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

### Error Handling Testing
```typescript
it("should handle upload errors gracefully", async () => {
  mockMultipartUpload.mockRejectedValue(new Error("Upload failed"));
  
  // ... execute upload
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(result.current.photos[0].error).toBe("Upload failed");
  });
  
  expect(Alert.alert).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    "Upload Failed",
    expect.stringContaining("Failed to upload")
  );
});
```
