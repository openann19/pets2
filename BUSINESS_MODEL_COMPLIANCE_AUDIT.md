- ✅ Price: $0/month
- ✅ Features: 5 daily swipes, Basic matching, Standard chat, Weather updates, Community support
- ✅ Swipe limit enforced: 5/day (not 50)
- ✅ Implementation: `PremiumService.ts`, `matchController.ts`, `usageTrackingService.ts`

### Premium Tier

- ✅ Implementation: `PremiumService.ts`, feature gates

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **AI Recommendations - Tier Gating** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: AI recommendations were gated as premium, but should be **Ultimate only** per business.md

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Updated `server/src/middleware/premiumGating.ts` - `requireAIMatching` now checks for Ultimate tier only
- ✅ Updated `server/src/routes/matches.ts` - Routes now use `requireAIMatching` middleware
- ✅ Added tier validation: Checks `plan === 'ultimate'` instead of just premium feature flag

---

### 2. **Read Receipts - Premium Gating** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Read receipts were implemented but not gated as a Premium feature

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added `requireReadReceipts` middleware in `server/src/middleware/premiumGating.ts`
- ✅ Updated `server/src/services/chatSocket.ts` - Socket handler now checks premium status before processing read receipts
- ✅ Gates read receipts to Premium+ users only (Premium or Ultimate tiers)

---

### 3. **Video Calls - Messaging Fixed** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Video call pages mentioned "Premium Plus" which doesn't exist in business.md

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Updated `apps/web/app/(protected)/video-call/[roomId]/page.tsx` - Changed "Premium Plus" to "Premium"
- ✅ Updated `apps/web/app/[locale]/(protected)/video-call/[roomId]/page.tsx` - Changed "Premium Plus" to "Premium"

---

### 4. **Premium Tier Service - Missing Implementation** ⚠️
**Issue**: `apps/web/src/lib/premium-tier-service.ts` is a stub

**Required**: Full implementation mapping features to tiers per business.md

---

## ✅ Features Already Compliant

1. **Swipe Limits**: ✅ 5/day for free, unlimited for premium
2. **See Who Liked You**: ✅ Properly gated with `requireSeeWhoLiked`
3. **Advanced Filters**: ✅ Gated with `requireAdvancedFilters`
4. **Super Likes**: ✅ Free users must purchase via IAP, Premium+ have unlimited
5. **Profile Boosts**: ✅ Premium+ only (can also purchase via IAP)
6. **Priority Matching**: ✅ Gated for premium users
7. **IAP Products**: ✅ All pricing matches business.md
