  - reports/state-matrix.md (new)
description: |
  Document and codify state-transition matrices for authentication, swipe/match, chat, and GDPR workflows.
  Capture preconditions, side-effects, analytics hooks, and failure recovery for each transition so engineers
  can validate business logic and QA can derive coverage. Deliver artifacts consumable by both mobile and server teams.
acceptance_criteria:
  - State diagrams or tables exist for Auth → Swipe → Match → Chat, Premium upgrades, Settings → GDPR, and Profile edits.
  - Matrices highlight offline, retry, and error-handling branches tied to telemetry events.
  - Documentation links to source code and testing strategy for each transition.
  - QA sign-off recorded in reports/state-matrix.md.
risk: MEDIUM
estimated_time: 3 days
rollback: Remove new documentation and revert related type annotations.
verification:
  - Manual review of reports/state-matrix.md
  - pnpm run lint --filter docs
