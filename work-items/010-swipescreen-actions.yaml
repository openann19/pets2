title: Restore SwipeScreen Critical Actions
priority: P0
scope:
  - apps/mobile/src/screens/SwipeScreen.tsx
  - apps/mobile/src/components/swipe/SwipeActions.tsx
  - apps/mobile/src/state/swipe/useSwipeActions.ts
  - packages/core/src/utils/chatUtils.ts
  - packages/core/src/types/index.ts
description: |
  Audit the SwipeScreen experience to ensure like, pass, super-like, rewind, and undo flows function with
  deterministic state transitions and analytics. Reconcile missing hooks, register consistent haptic feedback,
  and patch swipe reducers so premium capabilities (rewind, boosts) resolve instantly even when offline queueing
  is active.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Swipe actions update UI state, queue API calls, and track analytics within 200ms on target devices.
  - Undo/rewind respects premium entitlements and gracefully handles offline retries.
  - Automated tests cover double-tap like, drag gestures, and action sheet shortcuts.
  - No regressions in match creation or chat hand-off flows.
risk: HIGH
estimated_time: 4 days
rollback: Restore prior SwipeScreen version and disable experimental actions via remote config.
verification:
  - pnpm run type-check --filter @pawfectmatch/core
  - pnpm run test --filter "swipe"
