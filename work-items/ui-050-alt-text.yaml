context: |
  Screen reader users cannot access content without descriptive alt text.
  Many images lack accessibilityLabel or use generic text ("image", "photo").
  Decorative images should be marked as such to avoid clutter.
acceptance:
  - All <Image> components have accessibilityLabel
  - Decorative images use accessibilityRole="none" or accessible={false}
  - Alt text is descriptive and concise (not "image of...")
  - Pet photos include breed/name when available
  - User avatars include user name
  - Icons have accessibilityLabel matching their function
  - Automated test catches missing alt text
states:
  - compliant
  - missing-alt

risks:
  - Generic alt text may slip through
  - Dynamic content needs runtime alt text generation
rollback:
