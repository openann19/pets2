  Haptic feedback needs fine-tuning: heavy for superlike, light for like.
  Current behavior: Same haptic for all actions or no haptics.
  Why it matters: Better tactile feedback, clearer user actions.

acceptance:
  - [ ] Heavy haptic for superlike action
  - [ ] Light haptic for like action
  - [ ] Medium haptic for match
  - [ ] Success haptic for successful actions
  - [ ] Warning haptic for destructive actions
  - [ ] Test on iOS devices
  - [ ] Test on Android devices
  - [ ] Haptics feel appropriate for each action
