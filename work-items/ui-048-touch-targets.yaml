context: |
  Touch targets smaller than 44×44dp cause usability issues for users with motor impairments.
  Dense lists (matches, messages) have insufficient hitSlop causing missed taps.
  WCAG 2.2 Level AA requires minimum 44×44dp touch targets.
acceptance:
  - All interactive elements have minimum 44×44dp touch target
  - hitSlop added to dense list items with 8dp padding on all sides
  - Visual size can remain smaller if hitSlop compensates
  - Automated test verifies all Pressable/TouchableOpacity components
  - No overlapping touch targets
states:
  - compliant
  - non-compliant

risks:
  - Overlapping touch targets in dense layouts
  - Visual design may need adjustment
rollback:
  - Remove hitSlop additions
  - Restore original component sizes
