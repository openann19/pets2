  Deep link parser has unit tests, but navigation handoff lacks integration/E2E coverage.
acceptance:
  - Add `apps/mobile/src/navigation/__tests__/deeplink.integration.test.tsx`
  - Mount NavigationContainer; simulate incoming links for: chat, match, premium, settings
  - Assert correct screens and params; guard behavior for premium-only paths
states: [parsing, routing, guarded, error]
assets:
  tests: [apps/mobile/src/navigation/__tests__/deeplink.integration.test.tsx]
risks:
  - Navigator mocks timing; use `@testing-library/react-native` async helpers
links:
  - reports/mobile/test_gap_matrix.md
