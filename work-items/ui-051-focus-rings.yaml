acceptance:
  - All interactive elements show focus ring on keyboard focus
  - Focus ring has minimum 3:1 contrast ratio against background
  - Focus ring uses theme.colors.primary with 2px border
  - Focus ring visible in both light and dark modes
  - Tab navigation order is logical
  - useFocusRing hook available for custom components
states:
  - focused
  - unfocused
telemetry:
  - event: FOCUS_RING_AUDIT
    props: [component, hasFocusRing, contrastRatio]
