  TypeScript errors exist in codebase. Many @ts-expect-error suppressions found.
  Unsafe any types, missing type definitions, loose strict mode.
  Reports show baseline errors that need fixing.
acceptance:
  - pnpm mobile:tsc passes with zero errors
  - All @ts-expect-error suppressions removed or justified with comments
  - No any types in production code (changed scope)
  - Strict mode enabled in all tsconfig files
  - All components properly typed with proper prop types
  - No implicit any in function parameters
states: [baseline_audit, in_progress, fixed, verified]
telemetry:
  - event: TYPE_ERROR_DETECTED
    props: [file, line, error]
  - event: TYPE_ERROR_FIXED
    props: [file, line, fix]
assets:
  tests:
    - pnpm mobile:tsc (should pass)
    - pnpm mobile:lint (should pass)
  reports:
    - reports/ts_errors.json
risks:
  - runtime errors due to type mismatches
  - breaking changes to existing API contracts
  - performance impact from over-typing
rollback:
  - revert tsconfig to previous state
  - keep suppressions for critical paths
