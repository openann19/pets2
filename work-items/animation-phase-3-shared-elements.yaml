severity: critical
area: mobile
context: |
  react-native-shared-element is installed but underutilized. Need hero animations for pet card → detail screen,
  image → full screen viewer. This is critical UX polish that matches top-tier apps.
acceptance:
  - SharedElementTransition component created
  - Navigation transitions configured
  - Image prefetching implemented
  - Interrupted gesture handling
  - Works on iOS + Android
  - Reduced motion fallback
  - E2E tests for golden paths
  - Performance: 60fps transitions
states:
  - planning
  - implementation
  - testing
  - complete
telemetry:
  - event: SHARED_ELEMENT_TRANSITION_STARTED
    props: [fromScreen, toScreen, elementId]
contracts:
  request: { elementId: string, fromScreen: string, toScreen: string }
  response: { transitionComplete: boolean }
assets:
  tests:
    - apps/mobile/src/components/transitions/__tests__/SharedElementTransition.test.tsx
    - apps/mobile/e2e/shared-element.e2e.ts
risks:
  - Navigation cancellation edge cases
  - Performance on Android
  - Image loading failures
rollback:
  - Disable shared element transitions
  - Fallback to standard navigation
