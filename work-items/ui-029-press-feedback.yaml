severity: medium
area: mobile+ux
context: |
  Interactive elements lack immediate tactile and visual feedback.
  Users need confirmation that their tap registered before action completes.
  Combine scale animation, shadow softening, and haptic feedback for premium feel.
acceptance:
  - All Pressable components scale to 0.98 on press
  - Shadow opacity reduces by 50% during press
  - Haptic feedback (impact light) triggers on press start
  - Animation duration matches motion.duration.standard (200ms)
  - usePressAnimation hook available for custom components
  - Reduced motion users get haptic only (no scale)
states:
  - idle
  - pressing
  - released
telemetry:
  - event: PRESS_FEEDBACK
    props: [component, hasScale, hasHaptic, hasShadow, duration]

risks:
  - Performance impact on low-end devices
  - Haptic may drain battery if overused
rollback:
  - Remove press animation hooks
  - Restore original Pressable behavior
