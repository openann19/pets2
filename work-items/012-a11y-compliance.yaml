description: |
  Add accessibility labels, roles, and testIDs to every touch target; verify hit area sizing; and align Premium
  components with WCAG 2.2 AA requirements. Update shared UI primitives so both mobile and web inherit compliant defaults.
acceptance_criteria:
  - All touchables expose descriptive accessibilityLabel/accessibilityRole/testID combinations.
  - Hit slop or padding adjustments ensure 48x48 dp minimum tap targets.
  - VoiceOver/TalkBack walkthroughs confirm navigability for swipe, match, chat, premium upgrade, settings, and GDPR flows.
  - Automated a11y checks pass in CI and issues tracked with screenshots.
risk: MEDIUM
estimated_time: 4 days
rollback: Revert component changes and remove docs/a11y/labels.md.
verification:
  - pnpm run test:a11y
  - Manual assistive technology audit report attached to docs/a11y/labels.md
