  AMOLED displays waste battery with dark gray backgrounds.
  True black (#000000) saves significant battery on AMOLED screens.
  Need optional true-black mode for dark theme users.
acceptance:
  - True black option available in settings
  - Device detection for AMOLED displays (Samsung, Pixel, etc.)
  - User preference persists across sessions
  - Smooth transition between dark gray and true black
  - All UI elements visible on true black background
  - Battery savings measurable (if possible)
states:
  - dark-gray
  - true-black
telemetry:
  - event: AMOLED_MODE_TOGGLE
    props: [enabled, deviceType, batteryLevel]

  tests: [apps/mobile/src/theme/__tests__/amoled.test.ts]
risks:
  - Some UI elements may have insufficient contrast
  - Not all devices benefit from true black
rollback:
  - Remove AMOLED theme variant
  - Remove settings toggle
