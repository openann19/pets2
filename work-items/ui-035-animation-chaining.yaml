context: |
  Sequential animations feel robotic without natural delays between steps.
  Need micro-delays (30-60ms) to create natural-feeling animation sequences.
  Improves perceived quality and reduces cognitive load.
acceptance:
  - useAnimationChain hook provides delay utilities
  - Delays between 30-60ms for natural cadence
  - Configurable delay per animation step
  - Works with both Reanimated and Animated API
  - Respects reduced motion preference (skip delays)
  - Documentation includes best practices for delay timing
states:
  - idle
  - animating
  - complete
telemetry:
  - event: ANIMATION_CHAIN
    props: [component, stepCount, totalDuration, delaySum]
contracts:

risks:
  - Delays may feel sluggish if too long
  - Complex chains may be hard to debug
rollback:
  - Remove delay logic
  - Run animations sequentially without delays
