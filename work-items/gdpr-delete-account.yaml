owner: api
severity: critical
area: backend+mobile
context: |
  UI exists in SettingsScreen with delete account button, but backend service missing.
  GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure) requires actual account deletion capability.
  Current implementation: user can request deletion, but no backend handles it.
  Impact: GDPR violation, user data not actually deleted.
acceptance:
  - mock route DELETE /users/delete-account returns { success, message, gracePeriodEndsAt }
  - client service deleteAccount() implemented with proper error handling
  - Backend implements actual deletion logic with 30-day grace period
  - Detox E2E exercises full deletion flow and shows grace period UI
  - User can cancel deletion within grace period
states: [idle, confirming, requesting, grace-period, cancelled, completed, error]
telemetry:
  - event: GDPR_DELETE_REQUESTED
    props: [reason, timestamp]
  - event: GDPR_DELETE_CANCELLED
    props: [daysRemaining]
contracts:
  request: { password: string, reason?: string, feedback?: string }
  response: { success: boolean, message: string, gracePeriodEndsAt: string }
  errors: ["INVALID_PASSWORD", "ALREADY_DELETING", "RATE_LIMIT", "SERVER_ERROR"]
assets:
  mocks: [mocks/fixtures/gdpr/delete.success.json, mocks/fixtures/gdpr/delete.error.json]
  tests: [apps/mobile/src/screens/__tests__/Settings.GDPR.int.test.tsx]
risks:
  - accidental deletion without password check
  - user data not fully purged
  - orphaned data in relationships
rollback:
  - disable entry point button via remote flag
  - revert to previous service implementation
