context: |
  Need advanced gesture interactions: magnetic snap, momentum-based animations, velocity-scaled interactions.
  These enhance user experience for swipe cards, bottom sheets, and drag-and-drop interactions.
acceptance:
  - Magnetic gesture hook created with snap points
  - Momentum animation hook with velocity calculation
  - Velocity-based spring conversion utility
  - Haptic feedback on snap events
  - Works with reduced motion
  - Performance: 60fps maintained
  - Unit tests â‰¥75% coverage
states:
  - planning
  - implementation
  - testing
  - complete
telemetry:
  - event: MAGNETIC_GESTURE_TRIGGERED
    props: [snapPoint, velocity]
contracts:
  request: { gestureConfig: MagneticGestureConfig }
  response: { gestureHandlers: GestureHandlers }
assets:
  tests:
    - apps/mobile/src/hooks/gestures/__tests__/useMagneticGesture.test.ts
    - apps/mobile/src/hooks/animations/__tests__/useMomentumAnimation.test.ts
risks:
  - Gesture conflicts with existing swipe handlers
  - Performance issues on low-end devices
rollback:
  - Remove magnetic gesture hooks
  - Fallback to basic gestures
