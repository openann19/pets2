severity: high
area: mobile

  No E2E verifies push notification open flows (cold/warm/background). Risk: broken intents to chat/match/promo.
acceptance:
  - Create `apps/mobile/e2e/push.open.e2e.ts`
  - Simulate notification open (payload variants) on cold and warm app
  - Assert navigation target and tracking event emission
states: [cold, warm, background, error]
assets:
  tests: [apps/mobile/e2e/push.open.e2e.ts]
risks:
  - Platform-specific notification APIs; use Detox helpers or test doubles
