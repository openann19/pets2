severity: critical
area: mobile+a11y
context: |
  Users with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity need reduced-motion support.
  Currently, animations play regardless of OS preference (WCAG 2.1 violation).
  Must detect OS reduced-motion preference and replace animations with fades.
acceptance:
  - AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled() checked on mount
  - All animations replaced with opacity fades when reduced-motion active
  - No motion-based interactions broken (swipe, gesture handlers still work)
  - Preference changes detected and applied without restart
  - useReducedMotion hook available for all components
states:
  - reduced-motion-enabled
  - reduced-motion-disabled
telemetry:
  - event: REDUCED_MOTION_DETECTED
    props: [enabled, source]
  - event: ANIMATION_ADAPTED
    props: [component, adaptationType]
contracts:
  request: { preferenceCheck: boolean }
  response: { isReducedMotion: boolean, timestamp: string }
  errors: []
assets:
  hooks: [apps/mobile/src/hooks/utils/useReducedMotion.ts]
  components: [apps/mobile/src/components/**/*.tsx, apps/mobile/src/navigation/**/*.tsx]
  tests: [apps/mobile/src/hooks/utils/__tests__/useReducedMotion.test.ts]
risks:
  - Animation-dependent UX may feel less polished
  - Gesture handlers need careful testing with reduced motion
rollback:
  - Remove useReducedMotion checks
  - Restore original animation configs
