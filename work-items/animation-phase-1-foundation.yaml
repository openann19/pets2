severity: high
area: mobile
context: |
  Current animation system has multiple spring config sources (MotionPrimitives.tsx, constants.ts, configs/springConfigs.ts, GlobalStyles.ts, core types).
  Need to consolidate into single source of truth and add advanced physics presets (overshoot, velocity, mass-based).
  This is foundation for all other animation enhancements.
acceptance:
  - Single source of truth for spring configs in foundation/motion.ts
  - Advanced spring presets: overshoot, velocity, heavy, light, bouncy
  - All existing code migrated to new system
  - Velocity-based spring helper created
  - Secondary motion utilities added
  - TypeScript strict passes
  - ESLint zero errors
  - Unit tests â‰¥75% coverage
states:
  - planning
  - implementation
  - testing
  - complete
telemetry:
  - event: ANIMATION_SYSTEM_UPGRADED
    props: [phase, springPresets]

risks:
  - Breaking existing animations if migration not careful
  - Performance regression if configs not optimized
rollback:
  - Revert foundation/motion.ts changes
  - Restore original spring configs
