severity: medium
area: mobile+platform
context: |
  Haptic feedback is inconsistent with wrong haptic types for actions.
  Need semantic mapping of haptic categories to user intent.
  Improves tactile feedback clarity and platform idiom compliance.
acceptance:
  - Impact haptics for interactions (light, medium, heavy)
  - Notification haptics for alerts (success, warning, error)
  - Selection haptics for pickers and toggles
  - useHaptics hook provides semantic API
  - Haptic intensity respects system settings
  - Works on both iOS and Android (graceful degradation)
states:
  - enabled
  - disabled
  - unsupported
telemetry:
  - event: HAPTIC_FEEDBACK
    props: [component, hapticType, intensity, platform]
contracts:
  request: { hapticType: string, intensity: string }
  response: { fired: boolean, supported: boolean }
  errors: [{ code: "HAPTIC_UNSUPPORTED", message: string }]

  docs: [docs/HAPTICS_GUIDE.md]
risks:
  - Battery drain from excessive haptics
  - Platform differences may cause inconsistent feel
rollback:
  - Remove semantic haptic mapping
  - Restore direct Haptics API calls
