  - apps/mobile/e2e/**/*
  - apps/web/e2e/**/*
  - server/src/routes/**/*.ts
  - docs/testing/critical-journeys.md (new)
description: |
  Create deterministic E2E coverage for Auth → Swipe → Match → Chat, Premium upgrade billing, Settings → GDPR flows,
  and Profile edit scenarios across mobile and web. Share fixtures, seed scripts, and reporting so CI exposes journey health
  at a glance.

  - Failures capture screenshots, videos, and HAR files for debugging.
  - Documentation explains environment prerequisites and data reset strategy.
risk: MEDIUM
estimated_time: 5 days
rollback: Remove new specs and docs/testing/critical-journeys.md.
