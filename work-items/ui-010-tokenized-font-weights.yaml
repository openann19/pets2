  Font weights are inconsistent with inline fontWeight: "bold" throughout codebase.
  Need to enforce theme.typography tokens for all font weight usage.
  Improves consistency and makes weight changes centralized.
acceptance:
  - No inline fontWeight bold or fontWeight 600 in components
  - All text uses theme.typography tokens (body, h1, h2, h3, etc.)
  - ESLint rule enforces token usage (no-hardcoded-font-weights)
  - Visual consistency verified across all text elements
  - Typography scale documented with usage guidelines
states:
  - compliant
  - non-compliant
