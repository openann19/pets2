  Form submission errors require manual scrolling to find invalid fields.
  Users frustrated by having to hunt for validation errors.

acceptance:
  - Submit focuses first invalid field automatically
  - Smooth scroll animation to field (300ms)
  - Error message clearly indicated with icon and color
  - Keyboard opens automatically for text inputs
  - Works with all form types (login, register, profile, etc.)
  - Accessibility announcement for screen readers
states:
  - valid
  - invalid
  - focused
telemetry:
  - event: FORM_ERROR_FOCUS
    props: [formType, fieldName, errorType, scrollDistance]
contracts:
  request: { formData: object, validationSchema: object }
  response: { isValid: boolean, firstError: string, focusedField: string }
