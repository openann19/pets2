## ðŸŽ¯ Tier 1: Critical Performance Optimizations (High Impact)

### 1. **Advanced Bundle Optimization**

#### 1.1 **Hermes Engine with Bytecode Precompilation**
- **Current State**: Hermes enabled but not fully optimized
- **Advanced Technique**: Precompile JavaScript to Hermes bytecode during build
- **Impact**: 40-60% faster startup time, 30-40% smaller bundle
- **Implementation**: Add Hermes bytecode compilation to metro.config.cjs

#### 1.2 **Advanced Tree Shaking with Scope Hoisting**
- **Current State**: Basic tree shaking enabled
- **Advanced Technique**: Module concatenation + scope hoisting + dead code elimination
- **Impact**: 15-25% smaller bundle size
- **Tools**: @rollup/plugin-commonjs, webpack-bundle-analyzer

#### 1.3 **Selective Code Splitting with Route-Based Chunks**
- **Current State**: Basic lazy loading
- **Advanced Technique**: Split by route, prefetch next routes, service worker-style caching
- **Impact**: 50% faster Time to Interactive (TTI)

#### 1.4 **Bundle Analyzer with Automated Budget Enforcement**
- **Current State**: Manual bundle analysis
- **Advanced Technique**: CI/CD integration, per-module tracking, dependency visualization
- **Impact**: Prevent bundle bloat before it happens

### 2. **Runtime Performance Optimizations**

#### 2.1 **React 18 Concurrent Features**
- **Current State**: React 18.3.1 with basic features
- **Advanced Technique**: useDeferredValue, useTransition, Suspense boundaries
- **Impact**: 30-40% reduction in perceived lag

#### 2.2 **FlashList with Advanced Virtualization**
- **Current State**: Standard FlatList usage
- **Advanced Technique**: FlashList (Shopify) with automatic windowing, pre-render buffers
- **Impact**: 60fps scrolling with 10,000+ items (3-5x faster than FlatList)

#### 2.3 **Reanimated 3 with Worklets Optimization**
- **Current State**: Reanimated 3.3.0 basic usage
- **Advanced Technique**: All animations in worklets, zero runOnJS in hot paths
- **Impact**: Butter-smooth 60fps animations

#### 2.4 **Memory-Mapped Images with Progressive Loading**
- **Current State**: react-native-fast-image basic usage
- **Advanced Technique**: Progressive JPEG/WebP, blur-up placeholders, adaptive quality
- **Impact**: 50-70% faster perceived image load

---

### 3. **Advanced Memory Management**

#### 3.1 **Weak References for Cache Management**
- **Impact**: 20-30% memory reduction on low-end devices
- **Use Case**: Image cache, component state caches

#### 3.2 **Object Pooling for High-Frequency Operations**
- **Impact**: Reduced GC pressure, smoother animations
- **Target**: Swipe gestures, list scrolling

#### 3.3 **Selective Context Splitting**
- **Impact**: 50-70% reduction in unnecessary re-renders

---

### 4. **Network & API Optimizations**

#### 4.1 **HTTP/3 with QUIC Protocol**
- **Impact**: 30-40% faster API calls on mobile networks
- **Requirement**: Server-side HTTP/3 support

#### 4.2 **Request Batching with GraphQL or tRPC**
- **Impact**: 50-60% reduction in network requests
- **Options**: GraphQL with Apollo, tRPC with React Query

#### 4.3 **Service Worker-Style Caching**
- **Impact**: Instant UI updates, reduced data usage
- **Implementation**: Background sync queue, stale-while-revalidate

#### 4.4 **Adaptive Network Quality Detection**
- **Impact**: Reduced data usage, better UX on slow networks
