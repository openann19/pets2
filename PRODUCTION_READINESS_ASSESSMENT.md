## 🚨 Critical Production Blockers

### 1. God Components (HIGH PRIORITY)

| Component | Current Lines | Target | Status | Priority |
|-----------|---------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **HomeScreen** | 818 | <400 | ❌ Needs Extraction | 🔴 Critical |
| **SettingsScreen** | 689 | <400 | ❌ Needs Extraction | 🔴 Critical |
| **PremiumScreen** | 444 | <300 | ⚠️ Partial | 🟡 High |
| **MapScreen** | 183 | ✅ | ✅ Complete | - |
| **ModernSwipeScreen** | 307 | ✅ | ✅ Complete | - |

**Impact**: Maintenance nightmares, poor testability, difficult to debug

**Action Required**:
- Extract UI components from HomeScreen (stats cards, activity feed, quick actions)
- Extract sections from SettingsScreen (already using hook, but UI is bloated)
- Complete PremiumScreen refactoring (reduce by ~150 lines)

---

### 2. TypeScript Errors (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current State**: 
- E2E test type errors (Detox configuration issues) - **Non-blocking for production**
- Need to check actual production code errors

**Required Actions**:
```bash
# Check actual production code errors (exclude E2E tests)
cd apps/mobile && pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit

# Expected: <50 errors in production code
# E2E test errors are acceptable if isolated
```

**Validation Command**:
```bash
pnpm mobile:tsc \({}^{2}\)>&1 | grep -v "e2e/" | wc -l
```

---

### 3. Testing Coverage (MEDIUM PRIORITY Miami)

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Unit Tests** | ~33% | 75% | 42% |
| **Integration Tests** | Minimal | 75% | Large |
| **E2E Tests** | Foundation | Critical Paths | Needs Expansion |

**Required Actions**:
1. Add integration tests for critical user flows
2. Expand E2E test coverage for golden paths
3. Add performance tests
4. Validate test gates in CI

---

### 4. Theme Migration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current State**: ~30% complete (61 screens remaining)

**Required Actions**:
- Complete PHASE 1 semantic codemod for remaining screens
- Validate all screens use semantic tokens
- Remove legacy theme wrappers
- Ensure zero hardcoded colors vibrations

---

### 5. IAP Integration (LOW PRIORITY - Already Implemented)

**Current State**: ✅ Fully implemented, needs configuration

**What's Done**:
- ✅ `IAPService.ts` with RevenueCat integration
- ✅ Fallback simulation mode
- ✅ Purchase flow with server verification
- ✅ Restore purchases functionality

**What's Needed**:
1. Configure RevenueCat API keys:
   ```bash
   # In .env or app.config.cjs
   EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_IOS=your_ios_api_key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_ANDROID=your_android_api_key
   ```

2. Install RevenueCat package:
   ```bash
   pnpm add react-native-purchases
   ```

3. Configure products in RevenueCat dashboard
4. Test purchase flows end-to-end

**Status**: ✅ Code complete, ⚠️ Configuration required

---

### 6. Push Notifications (LOW PRIORITY - Already Implemented)

**Current State**: ✅ Fully implemented, needs validation

**What's Done**:
- ✅ `notifications.ts` service with full functionality
- ✅ Permission handling
- ✅ Notification channels (Android)
- ✅ Token registration with backend
- ✅ Notification handlers

**What's Needed**:
1. Test notification permissions flow
2. Validate token registration
3. Test notification delivery
4. Verify background notification handling

**Status**: ✅ Code complete, ⚠️ Testing required

## 📝 Notes

### Key Findings

1. **IAP & Push Notifications**: Already fully implemented! Just need configuration/testing.
2. **God Components**: 2-3 components still need significant refactoring.
3. **Testing**: Foundation exists, needs expansion to meet coverage targets.
4. **Theme Migration**: In progress,812 screens remaining.

### Recommendations

1. **Prioritize**: God component refactoring has highest impact on maintainability.
2. **Parallel Work**: Theme migration can proceed in parallel with other fixes.
3. **Quick Wins**: IAP and push notifications are code-complete, just need config.
4. **Testing Strategy**: Focus on integration and E2E tests for critical user journeys.
