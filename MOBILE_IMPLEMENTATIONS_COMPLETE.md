## ðŸ”„ Remaining Work (Non-Critical)

### Accessibility Labels
**Status:** Partial - Most components covered  
**Priority:** Low  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours

Some components need additional `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint` props. Core screens already have accessibility support.

**Files needing updates:**
- Individual button components
- Icon-only controls
- Some gesture-based interactions

### TypeScript Errors
**Status:** Some strict mode errors remain  
**Priority:** Low  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

Mostly related to:
- Type inference in complex generics
- Optional chaining in some auth flows
- Import type issues

---

## Implementation Details

### S3 Integration Pattern
All file uploads follow this pattern:
1. Generate unique S3 key: `generateKey(userId, extension)`
2. Upload to S3 with proper ACL
3. Register in Upload model for tracking
4. Return public URL

### Security Measures
- âœ… Authentication required on all endpoints
- âœ… Match access validation
- âœ… File type validation
- âœ… File size limits (10MB)
- âœ… Secure presigned URLs with expiry
- âœ… Grace period for GDPR deletion
- âœ… Password verification for account deletion

### Error Handling
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages
- Logging for debugging
- User-friendly error responses

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Chat reactions: Send and remove reactions, verify real-time updates
2. Attachments: Upload images/videos, verify S3 upload and URL
3. Voice notes: Record and send voice messages
4. Premium: Test subscription flow end-to-end
5. GDPR: Test data export and account deletion

### Integration Testing
- Mock S3 service for CI/CD
- Mock Stripe API for testing
- Socket.io connections
- File upload size limits
- Network error handling

---

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```env
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
S3_BUCKET=pawfectmatch-media
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
CLIENT_URL=https://app.pawfectmatch.com
```

### Stripe Setup
- Configure webhook endpoints for subscription events
- Set up product/pricing IDs for each plan tier
- Configure success/cancel redirect URLs

---

## Notes

1. **S3 Presign URLs** are set to 5-minute expiry for security
2. **File size limits** should be configured in both server and mobile app
3. **GDPR grace period** is 30 days - configurable via environment variable
4. **Socket.io** integration should be verified for real-time features

---

## Conclusion
