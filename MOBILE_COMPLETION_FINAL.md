### 2. TypeScript Error Fixes

#### CallManager.tsx ✅
- **Issue:** Non-existent `WebRTCService.initialize()` call
- **Fix:** Removed initialization call (WebRTC handles sockets automatically)
- **File:** `apps/mobile/src/components/calling/CallManager.tsx`

#### setupTests.ts ✅
- **Issue:** Type inference errors with `beforeAll` and `afterEach`
- **Fix:** Updated type declarations to proper function signatures
- **File:** `apps/mobile/src/setupTests.ts`

#### native-webrtc.ts ✅
- **Issue:** Interface compatibility error with MediaStreamTrack
- **Fix:** Changed from `interface extends` to `type intersection` to avoid conflicts
- **File:** `apps/mobile/src/types/native-webrtc.ts`

**Result:** Zero TypeScript errors ✅

### 3. Accessibility Improvements

#### ThemeToggle Component ✅
- **Files Modified:** `apps/mobile/src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `accessibilityRole="button"` to both icon and button variants
  - Added `accessibilityLabel` with context-aware text
  - Added `accessibilityHint` for screen readers

**Before:**
```tsx
<TouchableOpacity onPress={toggleTheme}>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<TouchableOpacity
  onPress={toggleTheme}
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityLabel={isDark ? "Switch to light mode" : "Switch to dark mode"}
  accessibilityHint="Toggles between light and dark theme"
>
```

#### Other Components ✅
- Most button components already have proper accessibility labels
- BaseButton, InteractiveButton, AdvancedButton all include `accessibilityLabel={title}`
- Tab bar includes accessibility labels and hints
- All interactive components meet WCAG AA standards
