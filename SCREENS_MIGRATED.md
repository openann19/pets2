- [ ] MapScreen.tsx

## Migration Pattern Established

### Standard Pattern:

```tsx
// 1. Add imports
import { ScreenShell } from '@/ui/layout/ScreenShell';
import { AdvancedHeader, HeaderConfigs } from '@/components/Advanced/AdvancedHeader';
import { haptic } from '@/ui/haptics';
import Animated, { FadeInDown } from 'react-native-reanimated';

// 2. Wrap with ScreenShell
return (
  <ScreenShell header={<AdvancedHeader {...HeaderConfigs.glass({ title })} />}>
    <ScrollView>
      {/* 3. Add animations to sections */}
      <Animated.View entering={FadeInDown.duration(220)}>
        {/* Section 1 */}
      </Animated.View>
      
      <Animated.View entering={FadeInDown.duration(240).delay(50)}>
        {/* Section 2 */}
      </Animated.View>
      
      {/* ... stagger delays by 50ms */}
    </ScrollView>
  </ScreenShell>
);

// 4. Add haptics to handlers
const handlePress = () => {
  haptic.tap(); // or haptic.confirm()
  // action
};
```

## Notes

- SettingsScreen had existing AdvancedHeader, just needed ScreenShell wrapper
- Both screens now use proper animation delays
- Haptic feedback added to all interactive elements
- Theme tokens used consistently throughout

## Next Steps

Continue manual migration of remaining screens using established pattern.
