## Recommendation

Given the scope of 750+ issues identified in the audit and the current state showing ~200 TypeScript errors, I recommend:

1. **Focus on highest-impact items first**:
   - Complete the remaining 4 adoption screens properly
   - Fix the security vulnerabilities
   - Address GDPR compliance gaps

2. **Consider a more targeted approach**:
   - Instead of fixing all 200+ TypeScript errors at once, tackle by category
   - Complete critical path items for production readiness

3. **Document what was accomplished**:
   - 2 files fully fixed
   - 5 files with import paths corrected  
   - Pattern established for remaining 17 files

Would you like me to continue fixing the remaining adoption screens one by one, or should we pivot to addressing the security vulnerabilities and GDPR compliance gaps first?
