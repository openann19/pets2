# Hook Migration Status - Phase 1 Complete ✅

## Summary

Phase 1 successfully connected all existing hooks to their corresponding screens in the mobile application.

## Completed Connections

### ✅ Core Screens with Hooks
1. **HomeScreen** → `useHomeScreen` - Stats, refreshing, navigation handlers
2. **SettingsScreen** → `useSettingsScreen` - GDPR, notifications, preferences
3. **ProfileScreen** → `useProfileScreen` - User profile, settings, privacy toggles
4. **MyPetsScreen** → `useMyPetsScreen` - Pet management, CRUD operations
5. **CreatePetScreen** → `usePetForm` + `usePhotoManager` - Form handling, photo uploads
6. **MapScreen** → `useMapScreen` - Location services, filters, stats

### ✅ Premium & AI Screens with Hooks
7. **PremiumScreen** → `usePremiumScreen` - Subscription management, Stripe integration
8. **MemoryWeaveScreen** → `useMemoryWeaveScreen` - Memory stories, animations
9. **AICompatibilityScreen** → `useAICompatibilityScreen` - AI analysis, pet compatibility
10. **AIPhotoAnalyzerScreen** → `useAIPhotoAnalyzerScreen` - Photo analysis, breed detection
11. **AIBioScreen** → `useAIBioScreen` - Bio generation, tone selection

### ✅ Social Features with Hooks
12. **StoriesScreen** → `useStoriesScreen` - Stories viewer, gestures, playback

## Changes Made

### App.tsx Updates
1. **Fixed AI Screen Imports** (Lines 41-42):
   - Changed from `./screens/ai/` subdirectory to root `./screens/`
   - AI screens now use the correct hook-connected versions

2. **Added MemoryWeaveScreen** (Line 71, 184):
   - Uncommented import
   - Added to navigator stack with hook integration

## Hook Architecture

All hooks follow a consistent pattern:
- Extract business logic from screens
- Handle state management
- Provide clean action handlers
- Include error handling
- Support loading states

### Hook Locations

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: UI components focus on rendering, hooks handle logic
2. **Reusability**: Hooks can be shared across multiple components
3. **Testability**: Business logic is easily unit testable
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to logic don't require touching UI code
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout

## Next Steps

Phase 1 is complete. Consider:
- Creating additional hooks for remaining screens
- Extracting shared hook logic
- Adding comprehensive test coverage
- Documenting hook APIs

## Verification

All screens passed linting and build verification. Navigation is functional with proper hook integration throughout the app.
