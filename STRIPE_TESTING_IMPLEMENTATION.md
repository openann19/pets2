# Stripe Testing Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy implemented for the PawfectMatch premium subscription system.

## What We've Built

We've created an extensive test suite focusing on reliability, security, and edge case handling for the Stripe integration:

### 1. Authentication & User Profile Tests

- **Token Lifecycle Tests** (`tests/integration/auth/token-lifecycle.test.js`)
  - Gracefully handles token expiration during active sessions
  - Implements client-side token refresh mechanisms
  - Validates active vs. expired tokens

- **Concurrent Sessions Tests** (`tests/integration/auth/concurrent-sessions.test.js`)
  - Handles multiple device logins correctly
  - Implements session revocation for "logout everywhere" functionality
  - Maintains independent session management

- **Token Security Tests** (`tests/security/token-security.test.js`)
  - Rejects JWT tokens with modified payloads
  - Prevents token reuse after user changes password
  - Handles malformed token inputs

- **Password Reset Security** (`tests/security/password-reset.test.js`)
  - Invalidates tokens after use
  - Enforces expiration policies
  - Implements protection against timing attacks

- **Input Validation Security** (`tests/security/input-validation.test.js`)
  - Prevents XSS attacks in user inputs
  - Blocks SQL/NoSQL injection attempts
  - Handles complex Unicode and special characters

### 2. Premium Subscription Tests

- **Stripe Checkout Flow** (`tests/integration/premium/stripe-checkout.test.js`)
  - Handles network interruptions during checkout
  - Maintains consistent state across the entire flow
  - Synchronizes subscription status across platforms

- **Webhook Resilience** (`tests/integration/premium/webhook-resilience.test.js`)
  - Implements idempotency for duplicate webhook events
  - Handles server restarts during webhook processing
  - Recovers from database connection issues

- **Premium Feature Race Conditions** (`tests/integration/premium/premium-feature-race-conditions.test.js`)
  - Manages access to premium features during subscription transitions
  - Handles subscription cancellation grace periods correctly
  - Controls concurrent access to limited premium features

### 3. Infrastructure Improvements

- **Webhook Handler Implementation** (`src/controllers/webhookController.js`)
  - Robust Stripe webhook processor with proper signature verification
  - Event-specific handlers for the subscription lifecycle
  - Idempotent processing to prevent duplicate event handling

- **Test Infrastructure**
  - Jest setup for comprehensive testing (`tests/setup.js`)
  - Stripe API mocking for reliable tests
  - MongoDB memory server for database testing

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test categories
npm test -- --testPathPattern=tests/integration/premium
npm test -- --testPathPattern=tests/security
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Stripe Webhook Handler

The webhook handler (`src/controllers/webhookController.js`) is now production-ready with:

1. **Security**
   - Signature verification using Stripe's webhook secret
   - Protection against replay attacks

2. **Reliability**
   - Idempotent processing of webhook events
   - Graceful error handling with appropriate HTTP responses
   - Proper logging of events and errors

3. **Subscription Lifecycle Management**
   - Handling for all relevant subscription events:
     - `checkout.session.completed`
     - `invoice.paid` 
     - `invoice.payment_failed`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`

### Edge Case Handling

The test suite specifically addresses critical edge cases:

1. **Network and Service Resilience**
   - Server downtime during webhook delivery (with retry handling)
   - Database connection issues during critical operations
   - Stripe API temporary unavailability

2. **User Experience Edge Cases**
   - Users attempting to access premium features immediately after purchase
   - Subscription cancellation and grace period handling
   - Concurrent access to limited features (e.g., profile boosts)

3. **Security Edge Cases**
   - Token expiration during active user sessions
   - Multi-device session management
   - Protection against various injection attacks

## Next Steps

1. **Monitoring**
   - Implement Stripe webhook monitoring and alerts
   - Track subscription conversion rates and failures
   - Monitor subscription lifecycle events for anomalies

2. **Recovery Processes**
   - Create admin tools for subscription recovery
   - Implement automatic recovery for common failure scenarios
   - Develop user-facing self-service recovery options

3. **Load Testing**
   - Test webhook handler under high concurrency 
   - Simulate peak traffic scenarios
   - Validate database performance with high subscription volumes
