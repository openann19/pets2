## Technical Implementation

### Upload Flow

```
1. User selects photos
   ↓
2. Photos automatically queued for upload
   ↓
3. Multipart upload starts with progress
   - Chunks file into 5MB parts
   - Uploads each part sequentially
   - Shows real-time percentage
   ↓
4. Upload completes to S3
   - Receives uploaded URL
   - Thumbnails generated (JPG + WebP)
   - S3 key stored
   ↓
5. Validation before submit
   - Checks all uploads complete
   - Verifies no errors
   ↓
6. Pet creation with photo URLs
   - Creates pet profile
   - Links uploaded photo URLs
   ↓
7. Success!
```

### API Endpoints Used

```typescript
POST /api/upload/multipart/create
  - Creates multipart upload session
  - Returns: { key, uploadId }

GET /api/upload/multipart/part-url
  - Gets presigned URL for part upload
  - Params: { key, uploadId, partNumber }

POST /api/upload/multipart/complete
  - Completes multipart upload
  - Body: { key, uploadId, parts: [{ETag, PartNumber}] }
  - Returns: { url, key, thumbnails: { jpg, webp } }
```

## PhotoData Interface

```typescript
interface PhotoData {
  uri: string;                    // Local file URI
  type: string;                   // MIME type
  fileName: string;                // Generated filename
  isPrimary: boolean;              // Primary photo flag
  
  // Upload tracking
  isUploading?: boolean;           // Upload in progress
  uploadProgress?: {               // Progress details
    uploaded: number;
    total: number;
    percentage: number;
  };
  uploadedUrl?: string;           // Final uploaded URL
  thumbnailUrl?: string;           // Optimized thumbnail URL
  s3Key?: string;                 // S3 object key
  error?: string;                 // Error message
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open CreatePetScreen
2. Tap "Add Photos" button
3. Select multiple photos from gallery
4. Verify upload progress displays
5. Wait for all uploads to complete
6. Verify success indicators appear
7. Fill out pet information form
8. Submit form
9. Verify pet created with photos

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Network interruption during upload
- ✅ Large file uploads (>5MB per part)
- ✅ Multiple simultaneous uploads
- ✅ Upload failures with retry option
- ✅ Removing photos during upload
- ✅ Submitting before uploads complete

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Multipart upload for large files (>5MB chunks)
- Background upload processing
- Thumbnails generated server-side
- WebP thumbnails for modern browsers
- JPG fallback for compatibility

### User Feedback
- Non-blocking UI during upload
- Clear progress indicators
- Immediate visual feedback
- Graceful error handling
