PawfectMatch Master Implementation Plan: From Audit to Excellence1. Introduction: Your MissionHello. You are an expert AI software engineer. Your mission is to execute a comprehensive refactoring and hardening of the "PawfectMatch" monorepo. This document is your complete, sequential guide. It synthesizes multiple deep-dive audits—covering code integrity, security, UI/UX, and feature completeness—into a single, prioritized action plan.Your goal is to systematically address every task in the order presented. Do not skip steps or phases. Your work will elevate this application to a secure, stable, performant, and production-ready state that delivers a world-class user experience.Guiding Principles:Sequential Execution: You MUST address all tasks in the precise order laid out below. Each phase builds upon the last.Announce Your Work: For each task, state which issue you are addressing before you begin.Explain Your Fixes: After implementing a solution, briefly explain the changes made and how they resolve the issue.Quality is Non-Negotiable: All new code must be clean, strictly typed, well-documented, and covered by unit tests.Preserve Business Logic: Your goal is to fix, complete, and enhance. Do not alter existing, functional business logic.Phase 0: Pre-Flight & Environment HardeningObjective: Establish automated quality gates to prevent regressions and ensure all future code meets our quality standards.Task 0.1: Implement Strict Code Quality GatesThe "Why": To automatically prevent buggy or insecure code from ever entering the main branch.Actionable Steps:Configure pre-commit hooks (using Husky and lint-staged) that run the following checks before any commit is allowed:TypeScript Compiler (tsc --noEmit) to catch type errors.ESLint to enforce code style and catch common errors.Prettier to format code consistently.Configure the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run these same checks, plus unit tests and a security audit (npm audit), on every pull request. The pull request must be blocked from merging if any check fails.Phase 1: Critical Triage & Codebase StabilizationObjective: Eliminate all critical security risks, compilation errors, and broken wiring. By the end of this phase, the application must be secure, stable, and runnable without errors.Task 1.1: Achieve Full TypeScript IntegrityThe "Why": To eliminate hundreds of hidden bugs and make the codebase predictable and safe at runtime. This is the single most important technical debt task.Actionable Steps:Navigate to apps/web/tsconfig.json and apps/mobile/tsconfig.json.Systematically remove one directory path at a time from the exclude array.After each removal, run tsc --noEmit. Fix every single TypeScript error that appears.Repeat until the exclude arrays are empty and the entire codebase is being type-checked.Globally search for and eliminate all instances of any. Replace them with specific, custom-defined interfaces (e.g., define PrivacySettingsInput for sanitizePrivacySettings, define MemoryMatch for match: any).Globally search for and eliminate all @ts-ignore and @ts-expect-error directives. Fix the underlying type errors. For browser-specific APIs (performance.memory), use proper type guards: if ('memory' in performance) { ... }.Globally search for and eliminate all eslint-disable statements, fixing the underlying linting errors.Success Criteria: The project compiles with zero TypeScript, ESLint, or any-type violations.Task 1.2: Remediate Critical Security VulnerabilitiesThe "Why": To protect user data and prevent common web attacks like XSS. This is a launch blocker.Actionable Steps:Web Token Storage:Go to apps/web/src/utils/analytics-system.ts and all other files using localStorage.getItem('auth_token').Refactor the entire web authentication flow to use secure, httpOnly cookies. The server must set this cookie on login. Client-side JS should no longer have direct access to the token.Mobile Token Storage:Go to apps/mobile/src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx.Replace all usage of AsyncStorage for authToken with a secure, encrypted storage solution like expo-secure-store.Dependency Audit:Run npm audit --audit-level=high in the root and in each package.Update all dependencies with high-severity vulnerabilities. Prioritize the Expo semver issue.Task 1.3: Repair Broken Wiring & Implement StubsThe "Why": To make the application runnable and ensure core features are connected to a backend.Actionable Steps:Fix Syntax Errors: Navigate to apps/web/app/(protected)/settings/page.tsx and correct the broken import statements and any other syntax errors.Implement Missing Core APIs:In the server/src/routes/ directory, create and implement the logic for these missing endpoints: /api/memories/${matchId}, /api/user/profile-stats, /api/user/filters, /api/user/privacy, and a GDPR-compliant /api/account/export-data.Connect Frontend Stubs:In apps/web/app/(protected)/settings/page.tsx, replace the alert('Filters applied!'); with a proper API call to the new /api/user/filters endpoint.In apps/mobile/src/screens/MemoryWeaveScreen.tsx, remove the hardcoded demo data (demo-match-id, etc.). Fetch real data from navigation parameters and use it to call the /api/memories/${matchId} endpoint.Phase 2: MVP Feature Completeness & Core UXObjective: Implement the essential features required for a viable product and fix the most jarring user experience issues. By the end of this phase, the app must be functional and usable.Task 2.1: Implement Critical Safety & Moderation FeaturesThe "Why": A social app without safety tools is irresponsible. These features are essential for user trust and MVP viability.Actionable Steps:Backend: Create API endpoints for POST /api/users/{userId}/report, POST /api/users/{userId}/block, and POST /api/users/{userId}/unmatch.Frontend:Add a "Report" button (with a reason selector) to user profiles and chat screens.Add a "Block" button to user profiles and chat screens. Once blocked, users should not see each other's content or be able to interact.Add an "Unmatch" button within the chat interface.Content Filtering: Implement a basic keyword-based content filtering system on the server to flag inappropriate text in profiles and messages for admin review.Task 2.2: Build the Admin PanelThe "Why": Admins need tools to manage the community and respond to reports.Actionable Steps:Implement the placeholder screens in apps/web/app/admin/.Create an AdminUserController to view user profiles, see reports against them, and take action (e.g., ban, suspend).Create an AdminChatController to review reported conversations.Implement the moderation components in apps/web/src/components/admin/ and connect them to the server moderation routes.Task 2.3: Enhance Core UX with Modern Performance PatternsThe "Why": To make the app feel fast, responsive, and modern, improving user perception and retention.Actionable Steps:Implement Skeleton Loaders: In apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx and other data-heavy screens, replace generic LoadingSpinner components with skeleton loaders that mimic the shape of the content being loaded.Implement Optimistic UI: For frequent actions like like/pass/superlike, update the UI immediately as if the action succeeded. If the server call fails, revert the change and show an error. Apply this in apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx.Implement Infinite Scroll: In feeds and long lists, replace pagination with infinite scrolling to load more content as the user scrolls down.Optimize Images: Ensure all user-uploaded images are processed, compressed, and served in modern formats (like WebP) from the server. Use the shared LazyImage component everywhere.Task 2.4: Implement Robust Error HandlingThe "Why": To prevent the app from crashing and to provide clear feedback to users when things go wrong.Actionable Steps:Global Error Boundaries: In apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx, create and implement a global AppErrorBoundary component to catch React rendering errors and display a friendly fallback UI instead of a white screen.Standardize API Errors: Refactor the entire server to return a consistent error format (e.g., { status: 'error', code: 'ERROR_CODE', message: '...' }). Update server/src/services/analyticsService.js to conform.Handle API Failures: In apps/web/src/services/api.ts, wrap all response.json() calls in a try/catch block to handle network and parsing errors gracefully.Phase 3: Design System Unification & UI PolishObjective: To create a beautiful, consistent, and accessible user experience across both web and mobile by strictly enforcing a single design system. By the end of this phase, the app must be consistent and accessible.Task 3.1: Unify Mobile App with the Shared UI PackageThe "Why": To eliminate duplicated work, ensure visual consistency, and make future updates faster.Actionable Steps:Go through the entire apps/mobile/src/ codebase.Audit every custom component in apps/mobile/src/components/.Replace every custom component (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) with its equivalent from the shared @pawfectmatch/ui package.Refactor all local StyleSheet implementations to use the props and variants provided by the shared components.Task 3.2: Enforce Design Token PurityThe "Why": To eliminate hardcoded "magic values," making the app themeable and ensuring perfect brand consistency.Actionable Steps:Globally search the entire codebase for hardcoded style values (colors, gradients, font sizes, spacing).Colors & Gradients: Replace every hardcoded color (e.g., bg-emerald-400, from-fuchsia-300) with a reference to a design token (e.g., theme.colors.success, theme.gradients.primary).Spacing: Standardize on a single spacing system based on design tokens. Refactor the mobile app's custom Spacing object and the web app's Tailwind config to use these tokens.Remove Inline Styles: In files like apps/web/app/page.tsx, move all inline style props to utility classes that reference design tokens.Task 3.3: Overhaul Accessibility (A11y)The "Why": To ensure the application is usable by everyone, including those with disabilities, and to comply with legal standards.Actionable Steps:Semantic HTML: Ensure a proper heading hierarchy (h1 -> h2 -> h3) on all pages. Use semantic tags (<nav>, <main>, <button>) correctly.Accessible Names: Add aria-label attributes to all icon-only buttons and interactive elements without clear text.Keyboard Navigation: Make all interactive elements (carousels, sliders, custom buttons) fully navigable and operable using only the keyboard. Implement visible focus states (focus-visible).Focus Management: In modals and dialogs, implement focus trapping so the user cannot tab outside the modal. When closed, focus must return to the element that opened it.Alt Text: Ensure all <img> tags have descriptive alt text.Color Contrast: Test all text and background color combinations to ensure they meet WCAG AA contrast ratio standards (4.5:1).Task 3.4: Standardize State ManagementThe "Why": To create a predictable and maintainable data flow throughout the applications.Actionable Steps:Establish a clear guideline for state management:Zustand: For global state shared across many components (e.g., user authentication status, notifications).useState/useReducer: For state that is strictly local to a single component (e.g., form input values).Audit the entire codebase and refactor any state management patterns that violate this guideline.Phase 4: Advanced Features & Professional PolishObjective: To implement features that differentiate PawfectMatch from competitors and elevate it to a professional, market-leading product. By the end of this phase, the app must be delightful and feature-rich.Task 4.1: Implement Advanced Social & Real-Time FeaturesThe "Why": To build a vibrant community beyond simple matching.Actionable Steps:Follow System: Implement a "Follow" feature distinct from "Liking." This allows users to subscribe to content without romantic interest.Rich Media: Add support for video uploads and displaying GIFs in chat and posts.Real-Time Chat: Upgrade the chat to be fully real-time using WebSockets. Implement typing... indicators, online status indicators, and read receipts.Push Notifications: Implement a robust push notification system (using Expo Push for mobile and a service worker for web) for new matches, messages, and follows.Task 4.2: Implement a Smart Feed AlgorithmThe "Why": To move beyond a simple chronological feed and show users more relevant and engaging content.Actionable Steps:Develop a v1 feed algorithm on the server that ranks content based on a weighted score of recency, user engagement (likes, comments), and user's past interactions (e.g., profiles they've liked).Introduce content diversity to prevent a single user from dominating the feed.Task 4.3: Consolidate & Enhance AI ServiceThe "Why": To leverage AI for a smarter, safer, and more engaging user experience.Actionable Steps:Consolidate the multiple Python apps (app.py, deepseek_app.py, etc.) in ai-service/ into a single, robust FastAPI application.Implement structured error handling in the AI service.Integrate AI features:Automated Moderation: Use the AI service to analyze text and images for inappropriate content, automatically flagging it for admin review.Content Suggestions: Provide users with AI-powered prompts to encourage posting.Personalized Recommendations: Use AI to generate "Users you might like" recommendations.Task 4.4: Deep Performance & Database OptimizationThe "Why": To ensure the app remains fast and scalable as user numbers grow.Actionable Steps:Bundle Size: Use @next/bundle-analyzer to identify large dependencies (Three.js, Framer Motion). Implement code splitting and lazy loading for features/components that are not needed on the initial page load.Database Indexing: Analyze slow database queries and add compound indexes to the database to optimize performance for common query patterns.Mobile Performance: On mobile, implement FlashList for any long, scrolling lists to ensure high performance. Add device capability detection to disable heavy animations on lower-end devices.Phase 5: Testing, Documentation & HandoffObjective: To ensure the long-term maintainability, reliability, and scalability of the project.Task 5.1: Achieve Comprehensive Test CoverageThe "Why": To prevent regressions and allow for confident future development.Actionable Steps:Write unit and integration tests for all new features and fixes implemented in the previous phases.Prioritize testing critical user flows: authentication, swiping, matching, and messaging.Replace all hardcoded mock data in tests with proper test factories (e.g., using a library like Factory Bot or MirageJS) to generate realistic test data.Success Criteria: Achieve a minimum of 80% test coverage across all packages.Task 5.2: Create Comprehensive DocumentationThe "Why": To enable new developers to onboard quickly and to serve as a reference for the entire team.Actionable Steps:API Documentation: Auto-generate interactive API documentation from the server code using a tool like Swagger or OpenAPI.Architecture Documentation: Update ARCHITECTURE.md with diagrams and descriptions of the final system architecture.Environment Variables: Fully document all required environment variables in the .env.example file with descriptions of what they do.Component Library: Use a tool like Storybook to document the shared UI components in @pawfectmatch/ui, showing all variants and props.Task 5.3: Finalize Configuration & DeploymentThe "Why": To ensure smooth, reliable deployments.Actionable Steps:Mobile Build: Complete the EAS build configuration in eas.json for all environments (development, preview, production) and execute successful test builds.CI/CD Optimization: Optimize the build scripts in turbo.json and package.json to parallelize tasks and leverage caching effectively, speeding up the CI/CD pipeline.Final Success MetricsThe project is complete when all tasks in this document are finished and the following metrics are met:Code Quality: 0 TypeScript errors, 0 any types, and 0 linting violations in the entire codebase.Security: 0 high-severity vulnerabilities reported by npm audit. All authentication is handled via secure, server-side mechanisms.Test Coverage: 80%+ test coverage across all packages.Performance:Web: <2MB initial bundle size and a Lighthouse performance score of 95+.Mobile: Smooth 60fps animations on mid-range devices.



4. App Store & Google Play Compliance Mandates

This section is non-negotiable. Failure to adhere to these rules will result in App Store and Google Play rejection.

User Safety & Content Moderation (UGC):

Reporting Mechanism: The app MUST provide a clear, accessible, and easy-to-use system for users to report offensive content, spam, or other users. This feature must be present on user profiles and individual content pieces.

Blocking Mechanism: The app MUST allow users to block other users to prevent harassment. Once blocked, a user must not be able to view, contact, or interact with the user who blocked them.

Content Filtering: A method for filtering objectionable content (e.g., profanity filter for text) must be implemented.

Published Policies: The app must include an easily accessible link to its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy within the app's settings.

Performance, Stability & Resource Usage:

Zero Crashes: The application must be rigorously tested to ensure there are no crashes or hangs. Any unhandled exceptions or errors that crash the app will lead to immediate rejection.

Launch Time: The app must launch quickly and present its initial UI without a noticeable delay.

Resource Management: Animations, background processes, and location services must be optimized to prevent excessive battery drain. Location services must be disabled when the app is not in use.

Privacy & Permissions:

Purpose Strings: For every permission request (Location, Camera, Photo Library, Notifications), a clear and concise purpose string (a.k.a. "usage description") MUST be provided that explains exactly why the app needs this permission.

Just-in-Time Requests: Permissions must only be requested "just-in-time"—that is, when a user first attempts to use a feature that requires it. Do not request all permissions on the first launch.

Platform Guideline Adherence:

Human Interface Guidelines (Apple) & Material Design (Google): The app must respect core platform conventions. This includes, but is not limited to:

Correctly using the "safe areas" on devices with notches and dynamic islands.

Not interfering with system-level gestures (e.g., swiping from the edge to go back).

Ensuring the UI is adaptive and looks good on all supported device sizes, including tablets.

Metadata Accuracy: All app metadata submitted to the stores (screenshots, descriptions, promotional text) must be an honest and accurate representation of the app's functionality. Misleading information is a common reason for rejection.
