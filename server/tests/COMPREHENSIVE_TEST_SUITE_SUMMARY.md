# Comprehensive Test Suite Summary

This document outlines the high-leverage test suites created for the PawfectMatch Community features, following production-grade testing best practices.

## Test Suites Created

### 1. Race Condition & Idempotency Tests
**File**: `tests/integration/community.race-idempotency.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- Like/unlike toggle atomicity under concurrency (20 concurrent requests)
- Multiple users can like same post concurrently without corruption
- Join/leave activity idempotency and capacity constraints
- Comment creation exactly-once semantics (retry-safe)
- Time boundary enforcement (cannot join after activity starts)

**Key Tests**:
- `like toggle is atomic and idempotent under concurrency`
- `multiple users can like same post concurrently without corruption`
- `join/leave invariants hold for random sequences`
- `capacity never exceeded under concurrent joins`

---

### 2. Property-Based Tests
**File**: `tests/integration/community.property-based.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- Toggle invariants (like/post, join/leave)
- Capacity & time boundaries
- Moderation state invariants
- Visibility invariants (blocked users)
- Pagination invariants (no gaps/dups)
- Privacy invariants (PII redaction)

**Key Tests**:
- `like(post, u) twice ⇒ likes count unchanged`
- `join(activity, u) twice ⇒ participant set size unchanged`
- `currentAttendees.length ≤ maxAttendees at all times`
- `concatenating pages yields no gaps/dups`

**Tool**: Uses `fast-check` for generative testing (10-50 runs per property)

---

### 3. Moderation Fail-Closed Tests
**File**: `tests/integration/community.moderation-fail-closed.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- Moderation service timeout → post becomes 'pending' (not auto-approved)
- Moderation service errors → fail-closed behavior
- Flagged media withheld from public feeds but visible to author + moderators
- Error handling for null/undefined/partial moderation results

**Key Tests**:
- `post is pending when moderation service times out`
- `post creation does not crash on moderation failure`
- `flagged media withheld from public feeds but visible to author`
- `handles null/undefined moderation results gracefully`

**Note**: Current implementation defaults to 'approved' on error (fail-open). Tests document this gap and recommend fail-closed behavior.

---

### 4. Authorization & Blocklist Boundary Tests
**File**: `tests/integration/community.authz-blocklist.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- Blocked users never appear in feeds/comments/mentions
- Attempts to interact with blocked users → 403/404
- Bidirectional blocking (A blocks B → B cannot see/interact with A)
- Pack membership/visibility rules (if packs are private)
- Block relationship persistence

**Key Tests**:
- `blocked users never appear in feeds`
- `blocked users never appear in comments`
- `attempts to like blocked user's post → 403/404`
- `A blocks B → B cannot see A's posts`
- `blocking same user twice is idempotent`

**Note**: Some tests document gaps where server-side filtering may not be fully implemented.

---

### 5. Offline/Outbox & Sync Conflict Tests
**File**: `tests/integration/community.offline-outbox-sync.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- Offline queue behavior (like, comment operations)
- Sync on reconnect (exactly once flush)
- Conflict resolution (LWW, vector clocks)
- User feedback states (syncing, synced, failed)
- Freshness badges reflect sync state

**Key Tests**:
- `queues like operation when offline`
- `flushes queued messages exactly once on reconnect`
- `LWW (Last Write Wins) for concurrent likes`
- `vector clocks for ordering concurrent comments`
- `shows "syncing" state during sync`

**Mocking**: Uses mocked `outboxSyncService` for offline queue simulation.

---

### 6. Security & Input Hardening Tests
**File**: `tests/integration/community.security-input-hardening.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- ObjectId fuzzing → 400 not 500
- Injection payloads (XSS, SQL/NoSQL, command injection)
- Rate limiting on write endpoints (like, comment, post, report)
- Media sanitization (MIME types, zip bombs, SVG/script stripping)
- Input validation (empty content, max length, invalid types)

**Key Tests**:
- `returns 400 (not 500) for invalid ObjectIds`
- `handles XSS payloads safely`
- `rate limits like endpoint`
- `rejects invalid MIME types`
- `strips scripts from SVG uploads`

**Fuzzing**: Tests 20+ invalid ObjectId formats, multiple injection payloads.

---

### 7. Performance Tests (k6)
**File**: `tests/performance/community-feed.k6.js`

**Coverage**:
- Feed pagination performance (p50/p95 budgets)
- Like operation latency
- Comment creation latency
- Activity join/leave latency

**Budgets**:
- Feed p95 < 800ms
- Like p95 < 800ms
- Comment p95 < 800ms
- Join/Leave p95 < 800ms
- Error rate < 1%

**Load Profile**:
- Ramp up: 10 VUs over 1min
- Sustained: 50 VUs for 3min
- Ramp down: 0 VUs over 1min

- JSON Schema validation for all request/response types
- Feed response contract validation
- Create post response validation
- Like response contract validation
- Comment response contract validation

**Coverage**:
- Correlation IDs in critical paths
- Latency metrics recording
- Error taxonomy (4xx vs 5xx classification)

- Golden traces for critical paths
- Sampling rules verification

**Key Tests**:
- `critical paths emit correlation IDs`
- `records latency for feed requests`
- `4xx errors are classified as user errors`
- `no PII in logs for user operations`
- `post creation emits golden trace`

**Note**: Tests log warnings where features may not be fully implemented

---

## Coverage Gaps & Recommendations

### 1. Mobile Store-Compliance Tests
**Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

**File**: `apps/mobile/e2e/store-compliance.e2e.ts`

**Coverage**:
- ATT (App Tracking Transparency) - iOS compliance
- Permissions gating (location, notifications)
- Account deletion end-to-end flow
- Data Safety alignment (Android)
- Notification deep-link idempotency
- Device-lab smoke tests
- Accessibility compliance

**Key Tests**:
- `does not request ATT if no tracking SDKs`
- `account deletion works without support contact`
- `tap "Reply" from notification lands in correct thread`
- `deep link is idempotent (multiple taps same result)`
- `cold start performance (p95 ≤ 2.5s)`

**Priority**: ✅ **Complete**

---

### 2. Data & Matching Quality Tests
**Status**: Not yet implemented

**Recommendation**:
- Property tests for play-fit fairness
- Cold-start recommendation diversity tests
- Adoption/safety content classification tests

**Priority**: Low

---

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/supertest": "^6.0.0",
    "fast-check": "^3.20.0",
    "p-map": "^7.0.1",
    "supertest": "^7.0.0",
    "@pact-foundation/pact": "^13.0.0",
    "ajv": "^8.17.1",
    "mongodb-memory-server": "^11.2.3"
  }
}
```

---

## CI Integration

### Quality Gates
These tests should be integrated into CI with the following gates:

1. **TypeScript**: `pnpm mobile:tsc` (strict pass)
2. **ESLint**: Zero errors
3. **Integration Tests**: All suites pass
4. **Performance**: k6 budgets met (p95 < 800ms, error rate < 1%)
5. **Coverage**: ≥ 90% for changed lines

### Example CI Step
```yaml
- name: Run Community Integration Tests
  run: |
    cd server
    pnpm test tests/integration/community.*.test.ts

- name: Run Performance Tests
  run: |
    k6 run tests/performance/community-feed.k6.js
```

---

## Notes

1. **Current Implementation Gaps**: Some tests document gaps where server-side filtering/validation may not be fully implemented (e.g., blocked user filtering, moderation fail-closed). These are logged as warnings.

2. **Mock vs Real**: Most tests use real MongoDB (MongoMemoryServer) but mock external services (moderation, outbox sync).

3. **Property-Based Testing**: Uses `fast-check` with 10-50 runs per property. Increase `numRuns` for more thorough coverage.

4. **Performance Budgets**: k6 tests enforce p95 < 800ms budgets. Adjust based on infrastructure capacity.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. ✅ Run test suites and fix any issues
3. ✅ Add contract/schema tests (JSON Schema validation)
4. ✅ Add observability tests (golden traces, PII redaction)
5. ✅ Add mobile E2E tests (Detox store-compliance)
6. ⏳ Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
7. ⏳ Set up mutation testing (Stryker) for test quality

## Quick Test Execution

Run all test suites at once:
```bash
cd server
./tests/run-all-tests.sh
```

This script will:
- Check dependencies
- Run all 8 test suites in order
- Provide summary with pass/fail counts
- Exit with error code if any suite fails
