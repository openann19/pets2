# Baseline Assessment Summary

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)  
**Status:** Infrastructure Complete, Ready for Testing

---

## Infrastructure Setup Complete

### ✅ Phase 1.1: Python Testing Infrastructure
- Created `ai-service/pyproject.toml` with pytest configuration and 90% coverage threshold
- Created `ai-service/pytest.ini` with test discovery and markers
- Created `ai-service/conftest.py` with fixtures, mocks, and utilities
- Created `ai-service/tests/` directory structure (unit/, integration/, fixtures/)
- Created `ai-service/requirements-dev.txt` with test dependencies
- Added sample test files for FastAPI app testing

### ✅ Phase 1.2: Coverage Thresholds Updated
- Updated `jest.config.base.cjs`: raised global thresholds from 70% to 90%
- Updated `apps/mobile/jest.config.cjs`: added per-package overrides (95% for services/core)
- Updated `server/jest.config.ts`: enforced 90% coverage with 95% for controllers/services
- Updated `apps/web/jest.config.js`: set 90% thresholds with component-specific overrides

**Coverage Standards:**
- Global: 90% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- Core packages/services: 95%

### ✅ Phase 1.3: Detox E2E Test Infrastructure
- Verified `apps/mobile/detox.config.cjs` configuration
- Created `apps/mobile/e2e/setup.ts` with global setup, teardown, and utilities
- Created `apps/mobile/e2e/helpers/navigation.ts` with navigation helpers
- Created `apps/mobile/e2e/helpers/assertions.ts` with enhanced assertions
- Created `apps/mobile/e2e/fixtures/testData.ts` with test users, pets, and scenarios

### ✅ Phase 1.4: CI-Ready Test Command
- Created `scripts/ci-all.sh` that runs: typecheck → lint → tests → coverage verification
- Added `pnpm run ci:all` script to root package.json
- Created `scripts/verify-coverage.js` to enforce thresholds and fail on violations

## Next Steps

### Phase 1.5: Initial Baseline Run
**Ready to execute:** (Will be executed in next session)

```bash
# Type checking baseline
pnpm -r typecheck > _reports/baseline-typecheck.log 2>&1

# Linting baseline
pnpm -r lint > _reports/baseline-lint.log 2>&1

# Test baseline with coverage
pnpm -r test -- --runInBand --coverage --json --outputFile=_reports/baseline-tests.json

# Python tests (after installing dependencies)
cd ai-service && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest -v --cov
```

### Expected Output
After baseline run, we will have:
- Complete inventory of TypeScript errors
- Complete inventory of ESLint errors
- Complete inventory of failing tests
- Coverage reports showing current vs target levels
- Prioritized fix list for Phase 2
