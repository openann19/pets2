### Phase 2: Reanimated Migration (3.5 hours)
**Fixes ~100 errors**
- Migrate useMotionSystem.ts
- Update component Reanimated usage
- Test animations

### Phase 3: Type Safety (2.5 hours)
**Fixes ~80 errors**
- Add null checks
- Fix argument type mismatches
- Fix type assignability issues

### Phase 4: Polish & Verification (1.5 hours)
**Fixes ~65 errors**
- Remaining property errors
- Import fixes
- Final type check
- Verification and testing

**Total Estimated Time:** 10-12 hours

## What's Needed for Phase 2

### Prerequisites

1. **Dedicated Time**
   - 10-12 hours uninterrupted
   - Full day recommended
   - With 2-hour buffer for unexpected issues

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Clean dependencies (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`)
   - Up-to-date packages
   - Git branch: `fix/mobile-type-errors`

3. **Resources**
   - Reanimated v3 migration guide
   - API client architecture documentation
   - Access to component library docs

### Execution Approach

1. Follow the 4-phase plan chronologically
2. Verify after each phase with `pnpm mobile:tsc`
3. Test critical paths after Reanimated migration
4. Commit after each completed phase
5. Document deviations or discoveries
