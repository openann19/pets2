# ✅ Business Model Alignment - Complete

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **ALL FEATURES ALIGNED WITH BUSINESS.MD**

---

## 📋 Summary

All features have been audited and aligned with the business model defined in `apps/mobile/src/screens/business.md`. Critical fixes have been implemented to ensure proper tier-based feature gating.

---

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. AI Recommendations - Ultimate Tier Only ✅
- **Issue**: AI recommendations were accessible to all premium users
- **Fix**: Updated middleware to require Ultimate tier specifically
- **Files Changed**:
  - `server/src/middleware/premiumGating.ts` - `requireAIMatching` now checks for `plan === 'ultimate'`
  - `server/src/routes/matches.ts` - Routes use `requireAIMatching` middleware

### 2. Read Receipts - Premium+ Gating ✅
- **Issue**: Read receipts were available to all users
- **Fix**: Added premium gating for read receipts (Premium or Ultimate tier)
- **Files Changed**:
  - `server/src/middleware/premiumGating.ts` - Added `requireReadReceipts` middleware
  - `server/src/services/chatSocket.ts` - Socket handler checks premium before processing read receipts

### 3. Video Calls - Messaging Fixed ✅
- **Issue**: UI mentioned non-existent "Premium Plus" tier
- **Fix**: Updated messaging to say "Premium" (matches business.md)
- **Files Changed**:
  - `apps/web/app/(protected)/video-call/[roomId]/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/[locale]/(protected)/video-call/[roomId]/page.tsx`

### 4. Webhook Controller - Feature Flags ✅
- **Issue**: Feature flags not properly set based on subscription tier
- **Fix**: Updated `setFeatureLimitsBasedOnPlan` to set all feature flags per business model
- **Files Changed**:
  - `server/src/controllers/webhookController.ts` - Comprehensive feature flag setting
