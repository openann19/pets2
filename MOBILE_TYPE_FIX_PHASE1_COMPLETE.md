# Mobile TypeScript Fix - Phase 1 Complete

## Summary

Phase 1 (Import/Export Hygiene) is complete. We've reduced errors from 561 to 559 errors by fixing broken imports and exports.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Missing Animation Hooks
Created the following hooks in `apps/mobile/src/hooks/useUnifiedAnimations.ts`:
- `useStaggeredAnimation` - For staggered list animations
- `useRippleEffect` - For ripple touch feedback
- `useShimmerEffect` - For shimmer loading effects
- `useScrollAnimation` - For parallax scroll effects

### 2. Fixed PremiumTypography Exports
- Added named exports for `TEXT_GRADIENTS` and `TEXT_SHADOWS`
- Fixed missing `MaskedViewIOS` import

### 3. Fixed Store Types
- Added `ThemeMode` and `NotificationCounts` types to `useUIStore`
- Added state management for `themeMode` and `notificationCounts`

### 4. Added Missing Components
- Created `EliteLoading` component
- Created `EliteEmptyState` component
- Added exports to EliteComponents

### 5. Fixed API Exports
- Re-exported `_adminAPI` from `adminAPI.ts`
- Added `_petAPI` and `_subscriptionAPI` exports for backwards compatibility
- Fixed `initializeNotificationsService` export from notifications service
- Exported `PerformanceMetrics` interface

### 6. Created Missing Constants
- Created `apps/mobile/src/constants/options.ts` with:
  - `SPECIES_OPTIONS`
  - `INTENT_OPTIONS`
  - `PERSONALITY_TAGS`
- Updated imports in `PreferencesSetupScreen.tsx`

### 7. Fixed Core Package Imports
- Fixed `RequestConfig` â†’ `UnifiedRequestConfig` import
- Stubbed out `useSwipeLogic` in ModernSwipeScreen (commented out in core)

## Remaining Errors

Current error count: **559** (down from 561)

Remaining errors are primarily:
- Phase 2: Theme access issues (theme.spacing.md, etc.)
- Phase 3: Missing type definitions
- Phase 4: Component prop mismatches
- Phase 5: Null/undefined safety
- Phase 6: Module system issues
- Phase 7: Core package issues (APIErrorClassifier, OfflineQueueManager, etc.)
- Phase 8: Long tail cleanup

## Next Steps

Move to Phase 2: Theme Access Clean-up
- Fix theme.spacing, theme.radius, theme.typography access patterns
- Update all components using incorrect theme paths
