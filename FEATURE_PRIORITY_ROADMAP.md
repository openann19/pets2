## Executive Summary

This roadmap prioritizes features based on business impact, technical debt reduction, and risk assessment. All P0 items are blockers and must be completed before production release.

### Priority Distribution

- **P0 Critical**: 4 features (13 days total) - **BLOCKERS**
- **P1 High Impact**: 9 features (~25 days total)
- **P2 Enhancement**: 4 features (~18 days total)
- **P3 Innovation**: 2 features (~14 days total)

**Total Estimated Effort**: ~70 days for complete implementation

## P0 CRITICAL - Blockers (MUST SHIP FIRST)

### 1. Real Authentication APIs ⚠️

**Priority**: P0-Critical  
**Effort**: 3 days  
**Risk**: High  
**Dependencies**: API service, AuthService, SecureStore

**What**: Replace mock login with production JWT token management and secure storage.

**Why**: Blocker for production deployment. Users must be able to authenticate securely.

**Success Criteria**:
- Working login/register/reset flow with secure token storage
- Automatic token refresh
- Biometric authentication integrated
- Zero security vulnerabilities

**Files**:
- `apps/mobile/src/stores/useAuthStore.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/services/AuthService.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/utils/secureStorage.ts`

**Work Item**: WI-004

### 2. Premium Subscription Gating 💳

**Priority**: P0-Critical  
**Effort**: 4 days  
**Risk**: High  
**Dependencies**: Stripe integration, PremiumService

**What**: Block premium features behind payment verification.

**Why**: Revenue blocker. Premium features must be properly gated.

**Success Criteria**:
- Working subscription purchase and feature gating
- Stripe integration functional
- Payment verification prevents unauthorized access
- Restore purchases works

**Files**:
- `apps/mobile/src/services/PremiumService.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/screens/premium/*`
- All premium-gated features

**Work Item**: WI-005

### 3. Admin Dashboard MVP 🛡️

**Priority**: P0-Critical  
**Effort**: 4 days  
**Risk**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: Admin screens, API integration

**What**: Complete moderation dashboard with approval workflow.

**Why**: Required for platform moderation and user safety.

**Success Criteria**:
- Functional content moderation system
- User management tools operational
- Real-time stats display correctly
- Approval workflow complete

**Files**:
- `apps/mobile/src/screens/admin/*.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/services/adminAPI.ts`

**Work Item**: WI-006

---

### 4. Type Safety Fixes 🔒

**Priority**: P0-Critical  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Risk**: Low  
**Dependencies**: TypeScript strict mode

**What**: Remove all @ts-ignore comments and fix type errors.

**Why**: Critical for code quality, IDE support, and preventing runtime errors.

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero TypeScript errors, strict type checking
- No @ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error in codebase
- Improved code maintainability

**Files**: All TypeScript files in mobile app

**Work Item**: WI-007
