# Multi-Agent System Workflow Summary

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Product Reasoner (PR) - COMPLETE

### Deliverables Generated:
1. **`reports/product_model.json`** - Complete product model with:
   - 6 core entities (User, Pet, Match, Message, Subscription, Adoption)
   - 10 user journeys mapped to screens and states
   - Feature catalog organized by priority (core, premium, AI, security, admin)
   - Technical stack documentation

2. **`reports/navigation_graph.json`** - Navigation mapping showing:
   - All screens with routes and params
   - Guard conditions for authentication
   - Category groupings (auth, main, settings, premium, AI, pets, admin)

3. **`reports/gap_log.yaml`** - Initial gap identification with 12 critical gaps:
   - GDPR compliance (delete account, export data)
   - Chat enhancements (reactions, attachments, voice notes)
   - Premium subscription flow
   - TypeScript safety issues
   - AI features missing backend
   - A11y and performance issues

### Key Findings:

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. **GDPR Non-Compliance**: Backend deletion endpoint missing (`DELETE /users/delete-account`)
2. **Data Export Missing**: GDPR Article 20 not implemented (`GET /users/export-data`)
3. **Chat UI vs Reality**: Reaction buttons and attachment picker exist but don't work
4. **TypeScript Errors**: 28+ type errors found in baseline audit
5. **Premium Features Not Gated**: AI features accessible without subscription

**Product Model Insights:**
- App has sophisticated entity model with rich relationships
- 10 distinct user journeys from onboarding to admin
- Premium features clearly defined (Basic, Premium, Ultimate tiers)
- AI features included but not fully integrated

## üîÑ Phase 2: Current Status

### TypeScript Guardian (TG) - In Progress
**Audit Results**: TypeScript type-check revealed multiple errors:
- SafeAreaView props issues
- Animated style type mismatches  
- Missing override modifiers in ErrorBoundary
- Gesture handler callback type issues
- Style array composition problems

**Next Actions:**
- Fix advanced component type errors
- Add missing override modifiers
- Resolve animated style conflicts
- Clean up gesture handler types

### Work Items Created:
1. **`work-items/gdpr-delete-account.yaml`** - GDPR deletion implementation
2. **`work-items/chat-reactions-attachments.yaml`** - Chat enhancements
3. **`work-items/typescript-safety.yaml`** - Type safety improvements

### Directory Structure Created:

## üéØ Quality Gates (CI Requirements)

According to AGENTS.md workflow, all PRs must pass:

‚úÖ **TypeScript**: `pnpm mobile:tsc` - **CURRENTLY FAILING** (28+ errors)
‚è≥ **ESLint**: `pnpm mobile:lint` - Not yet run
‚è≥ **Tests**: `pnpm mobile:test:cov` - Not yet run
‚è≥ **A11y**: `pnpm mobile:a11y` - Not yet run
‚è≥ **Perf**: `pnpm mobile:perf` - Not yet run
‚è≥ **E2E**: Detox golden paths - Not yet run

## üö® Priority Actions

Based on the gap analysis, the highest priority work items are:

1. **TypeScript Safety** (Critical) - Fix 28+ type errors before proceeding
2. **GDPR Delete Account** (Critical) - Backend endpoint + client service
3. **GDPR Export Data** (Critical) - Data portability implementation
4. **Chat Reactions** (High) - Service + backend endpoint
5. **Chat Attachments** (High) - File upload service
6. **AI Compatibility Backend** (High) - AI service integration

---

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Strategy

Following AGENTS.md principles:
- **Contracts First**: API specs before implementation
- **Tests First**: Acceptance tests before code
- **Evidence-Based**: Every change needs tests + reports
- **Atomic PRs**: Small, reversible increments

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. Complete TypeScript error fixes
2. Generate API contracts (OpenAPI spec)
3. Create mock server with GDPR endpoints
4. Write acceptance tests for top 3 gaps
5. Implement fixes in priority order
