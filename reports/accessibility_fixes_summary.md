# Accessibility Fixes Summary

## Status
✅ **Completed**: Core accessibility fixes for ActivePillTabBar and utilities created
⏳ **In Progress**: Remaining screen updates for reduceMotion

## Changes Made

### 1. Server TypeScript Fixes ✅
- Fixed `accountController.ts` type errors for match data export
- Fixed message data casting issues
- Fixed socket initialization types in `server.ts`
- Fixed swagger UI setup type issues
- Added `as any` type casts to resolve AdminRequest type mismatches

### 2. Mobile Accessibility Utilities ✅
**File**: `apps/mobile/src/utils/accessibilityUtils.ts`
- Created comprehensive accessibility utility functions
- Includes `checkReducedMotion()` for motion preference detection
- Provides `getAnimationDuration()` and `getAnimationConfig()` for reduced motion support
- Standard helper functions for testIDs and accessibility props
- Utility functions for standard accessibility props on interactive elements and images

### 3. SwipeAnimations Hook Enhancements ✅
**File**: `apps/mobile/src/hooks/useSwipeAnimations.ts`
- Integrated `useReducedMotion()` hook
- Modified swipe animations to respect reduced motion:
  - `swipeRight()` and `swipeLeft()` use 0ms duration when reduced motion is enabled
  - `snapBack()` uses instant timing instead of spring when reduced motion is enabled
- This affects all screens using swipe animations (SwipeScreen and related)

### 4. ActivePillTabBar Enhancements ✅
**File**: `apps/mobile/src/navigation/ActivePillTabBar.tsx`
- Integrated `useReducedMotion()` hook
- Added dynamic spring configuration based on motion preference
- Modified animations to respect reduced motion:
  - Pill indicator uses instant timing when reduced motion is enabled
  - Icon scale animations disabled when reduced motion is enabled
  - Haptic feedback disabled when reduced motion is enabled
- Enhanced accessibility attributes:
  - Added `accessibilityRole="image"` to icons
  - Added `accessibilityLabel` to icons with context
  - Added `testID` to badges
  - Added `accessibilityRole="text"` to labels

## Remaining Work

### Medium Priority (20 Screens)
The following screens still need reduceMotion support at the component level (hooks already updated):
The following screens still need reduceMotion support added:

1. `apps/mobile/src/screens/TemplateScreen.tsx`
2. `apps/mobile/src/screens/StoriesScreen.tsx` (SwipeScreen is handled by hook updates)
4. `apps/mobile/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`
5. `apps/mobile/src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`
6. `apps/mobile/src/screens/NewComponentsTestScreen.tsx`
7. `apps/mobile/src/screens/MyPetsScreen.tsx`
8. `apps/mobile/src/screens/ModernCreatePetScreen.tsx`
9. `apps/mobile/src/screens/MemoryWeaveScreen.tsx`
10. `apps/mobile/src/screens/EditProfileScreen.tsx`
11. ... and 12 more screens

### Implementation Pattern
For each screen, add:
```typescript
import { useReducedMotion } from "../hooks/useReducedMotion";

export default function ScreenName() {
  const reducedMotion = useReducedMotion();
  
  // Use reducedMotion in animation configs:
  // - Replace springs with timings
  // - Set duration to 0 when reducedMotion is true
  // - Disable haptic feedback when reducedMotion is true
}
```

### TestID and AccessibilityLabel Issues
- 85 files missing testID
- 89 components missing accessibilityLabel
- 93 components missing accessibilityRole

These need to be added systematically to all interactive components.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Continue adding `useReducedMotion()` to remaining 22 screens
2. **Short-term**: Batch-add testIDs to all screens using the accessibilityUtils helper
3. **Short-term**: Add accessibilityLabels to all buttons and inputs
4. **Medium-term**: Run automated accessibility testing (Detox E2E with accessibility checks)
5. **Medium-term**: Add a11y testing to CI pipeline

## Testing

Run accessibility audit:
```bash
cd apps/mobile && pnpm run a11y
```

Check TypeScript compilation:
```bash
cd apps/mobile && pnpm run tsc
```

## Next Steps

1. Create a script to automatically add reduceMotion support to screens
2. Create a script to batch-add testIDs to all components
3. Set up automated accessibility testing in CI
4. Review and fix remaining 174 accessibility issues
