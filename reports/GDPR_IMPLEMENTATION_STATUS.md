// Run daily as a scheduled job
import { processExpiredDeletions } from './services/deletionService';

// Process all users past their grace period
const results = await processExpiredDeletions();

// Get deletion statistics
const stats = await getDeletionStats();
```

**Data Cleanup:**
- ✅ Matches deleted
- ✅ Conversations deleted
- ✅ Messages removed from conversations
- ✅ Analytics events deleted
- ✅ Notifications deleted
- ✅ User profile deleted (hard delete)

## Client Implementation

### GDPR Service
**File:** `apps/mobile/src/services/gdprService.ts`

**Methods:**
- `deleteAccount(data)` - Request account deletion
- `cancelDeletion()` - Cancel pending deletion
- `getAccountStatus()` - Check deletion status
- `exportUserData(data)` - Request data export
- `downloadExport(exportId)` - Download exported data

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { gdprService } from '@/services/gdprService';

// Request deletion
const result = await gdprService.deleteAccount({
  password: 'user-password',
  reason: 'no-longer-needed',
  feedback: 'Great app but not using it anymore'
});

// Check status
const status = await gdprService.getAccountStatus();

// Export data
const export = await gdprService.exportUserData({
  format: 'json' // or 'csv'
});
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] Deletion request creation
- [ ] Password validation
- [ ] Grace period calculation
- [ ] Cancellation logic
- [ ] Background processing
- [ ] Data export (JSON)
- [ ] Data export (CSV)
- [ ] Data completeness verification

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Full deletion flow with 30-day delay
- [ ] Cancellation during grace period
- [ ] Hard deletion after grace period
- [ ] Export download flow
- [ ] Associated data cleanup

### E2E Tests Needed
- [ ] User requests deletion → sees grace period
- [ ] User cancels deletion → account reactivated
- [ ] User requests export → receives data
- [ ] After grace period → account deleted

## Integration Instructions

### Backend: Add Background Job
```typescript
// In server/src/index.ts or cron job
import cron from 'node-cron';
import { processExpiredDeletions } from './services/deletionService';

// Run daily at 2 AM
cron.schedule('0 2 * * *', async () => {
  console.log('Processing expired deletions...');
  const results = await processExpiredDeletions();
  console.log(`Completed: ${results.filter(r => r.success).length} successful`);
});
```

### Frontend: Add GDPR UI
```typescript
// In Settings screen
import { gdprService } from '@/services/gdprService';

const handleDeleteAccount = async () => {
  const confirmed = await confirm(
    'Are you sure? Your account will be deleted in 30 days.'
  );
  
  if (!confirmed) return;
  
  const result = await gdprService.deleteAccount({
    password: enteredPassword,
    reason: selectedReason
  });
  
  if (result.success) {
    showSuccess('Account deletion scheduled');
  }
};
```
