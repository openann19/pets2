## CI/CD Integration

For automated builds via GitHub Actions, add this workflow:

```yaml
name: Mobile App Build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'apps/mobile/**'
      - 'packages/core/**'
      - 'packages/ui/**'

jobs:
  eas-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: üì± Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: üèóÔ∏è Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18.x
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: üì¶ Install dependencies
        run: |
          npm install -g pnpm
          pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: üîê Setup EAS
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}

      - name: üß™ Run tests
        run: pnpm test --filter=@pawfectmatch/mobile

      - name: üèóÔ∏è Build app
        run: |
          cd apps/mobile
          eas build --platform all --profile production --non-interactive
```

## Post-Release Monitoring

1. Monitor crash reports and error tracking via Sentry
2. Track user adoption via Firebase Analytics
3. Monitor app reviews and ratings in both stores
4. Prepare for potential hotfix releases if critical issues are found
