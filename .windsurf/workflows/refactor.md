# Refactor Workflow

This workflow outlines the process for refactoring code in the PawfectMatch monorepo.

## Steps

1. **Identify Refactoring Target**
   - Review code for technical debt, performance issues, or maintainability concerns
   - Prioritize based on impact and effort

2. **Analyze Dependencies**
   - Check for dependent modules and tests
   - Plan for backward compatibility

3. **Implement Changes**
   - Make incremental changes with tests
   - Update documentation as needed

4. **Validate**
   - Run full test suite
   - Check for regressions
   - Update type definitions if necessary

5. **Commit**
   - Follow conventional commit format
   - Update changelog if applicable

## Guidelines

- Always maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Update tests and documentation alongside code changes
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow established design patterns
