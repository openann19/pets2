# Mobile App Gaps Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation work completed to address critical mobile app gaps, App Store compliance, and technical infrastructure improvements.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: App Store Compliance ✅

**Implemented:**
- Age rating configuration in `app.config.cjs` (iOS: 4+, Android: Everyone)
- Explicit Terms of Service and Privacy Policy links in `RegisterScreen.tsx`
- App Transport Security (ATS) enforcement - HTTPS validation in production builds
- `usesNonExemptEncryption: false` declaration for App Store Connect

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/mobile/app.config.cjs`
- `apps/mobile/src/screens/RegisterScreen.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/services/apiClient.ts`

---

### Phase 2: Push Notifications Enhancement ✅

#### 2.1 Notification Preferences UI & API ✅
- Completed API client integration (`notificationPreferencesAPI`) in `apps/mobile/src/services/api.ts`
- UI already exists in `NotificationPreferencesScreen.tsx`

#### 2.2 Badge Count Integration ✅
- Created `useBadgeCount` hook (`apps/mobile/src/hooks/useBadgeCount.ts`)
- Integrated badge count management in main `App.tsx`
- Enhanced `notificationService` to automatically increment/decrement badge count on notification receipt and response

#### 2.3 Notification Permission Flow Enhancement ✅
- Enhanced `NotificationService` with better permission handling:
  - `getPermissionStatus()` - Check status without requesting
  - `requestPermission()` - Request with better UX
  - Delayed permission request (no auto-request on app launch)
- Created `NotificationPermissionPrompt` component with:
  - In-app explanation before system prompt
  - Clear benefits (matches, messages, likes)
  - Settings deep-link on denial

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/mobile/src/services/notifications.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/components/NotificationPermissionPrompt.tsx` (new)
- `apps/mobile/src/App.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/hooks/useBadgeCount.ts` (new)

---

### Phase 3: In-App Purchases (IAP) Completion ✅

#### 3.1 Receipt Validation Enhancement ✅
- Added timeout protection (10 seconds max)
- Implemented retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s)
- Better error handling and logging

#### 3.2 Restore Purchases UI ✅
- Added "Restore Purchases" button to `PremiumScreen.tsx`
- Integrated restore functionality in `usePremiumScreen` hook
- Enhanced `ManageSubscriptionScreen.tsx` with system subscription management link

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/mobile/src/services/IAPService.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/hooks/screens/usePremiumScreen.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/screens/premium/PremiumScreen.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/screens/ManageSubscriptionScreen.tsx`

---

### Phase 4: Camera & Media Handling Enhancement ✅

#### 4.1 Permission Flow Improvements ✅
- Enhanced permission request functions with better error messages
- Added Settings deep-link when permissions denied
- Clearer explanations for camera and photo library access

#### 4.2 File Size Validation ✅
- Added `validateImageFileSize()` function (max 10MB)
- Validates before processing in both `pickAndProcessImage()` and `captureAndProcessImage()`
- User-friendly error messages with file size information

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/mobile/src/services/uploadHygiene.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/components/ModernPhotoUploadWithEditor.tsx`

---

### Phase 5: Security & Privacy Hardening ✅

**Verified Existing Implementation:**
- ✅ Biometric authentication using `expo-local-authentication`
- ✅ Secure storage using `expo-secure-store` for sensitive data
- ✅ Keychain integration for tokens with biometric protection
- ✅ Proper security level usage (`LocalAuthentication.SecurityLevel`)
- ✅ Encrypted storage with biometric authentication for sensitive data

**Security Features Confirmed:**
- Token storage in SecureStore/Keychain (not AsyncStorage)
- Biometric encryption/decryption for sensitive data
- Proper access control settings (WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY)
- Fallback mechanisms for robustness

**Files Reviewed:**
- `apps/mobile/src/services/BiometricService.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/services/AuthService.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/services/apiClient.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/utils/secureStorage.ts`

---

## Technical Improvements Summary

### Permission Handling
- Better UX with in-app explanations before system prompts
- Settings deep-links on denial
- Graceful error handling and user feedback

### IAP & Subscriptions
- Robust receipt validation with timeout and retry
- Restore purchases functionality
- System subscription management links

### Media Handling
- File size validation (10MB max)
- Enhanced permission flows
- Better error messages

### Security
- Verified secure storage implementation
- Confirmed biometric authentication security
- Token storage in secure keychain

---

#### 2.4 Notification Service Initialization ✅
- Service initializes on app start (without auto-requesting permission)
- Token automatically initialized when permission is granted via prompt
- Proper listener setup after permission granted
- Files: `apps/mobile/src/App.tsx`, `apps/mobile/src/services/notifications.ts`

---

## Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Testing & Validation:**
   - E2E tests for restore purchases flow
   - Permission denial flow testing
   - File size validation edge cases

2. **Store Submission:**
   - Generate Android Data Safety JSON
   - Submit iOS Privacy Manifest
   - App Store screenshots and metadata
   - Store listing optimization

3. **Performance:**
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Asset optimization (WebP/AVIF)
   - Dead code elimination verification
